<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services &amp; Accessioning Archivist</p>



<p>One of UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections’ most famous and beloved collections is the Japanese Woodblock Print collection – a collection of over 400 colorful and informative woodblock prints on health-related themes, such as women’s health and contagious diseases like cholera, measles, and smallpox. According to the Library website dedicated to the prints, they “offer a visual account of Japanese medical knowledge in the late Edo and Meiji periods. The majority of the prints date to the mid-late nineteenth century, when Japan was opening to the West after almost two hundred and fifty years of self-imposed isolation.”<a href="./#_ftn1">[1]</a> The collection has been used, most recently, in a documentary about woodblock prints to be aired on NHK, Japan’s public broadcasting network, and has been a subject of enduring interest to researchers. I’ve heard colleagues wonder aloud about how UCSF came to own this unique collection, so I did some research. Naturally, an enterprising curator and librarian – Atsumi Minami, MLS – is to thank for the collection’s arrival at UCSF.</p>

UCSF History Collection. </figcaption></figure>



<p>While I was not able to find the exact dates of her employment at UCSF Library, I do know that Minami began working at UCSF Library in 1959, and soon took charge of a small collection of 70 titles of materials related to East Asian medicine started in 1963 by John B. de C.M. Saunders (a shortening of his full name, John&nbsp;Bertrand de Cusance Morant&nbsp;Saunders), then Provost and University Librarian.<a href="./#_ftn1">[1]</a> Minami could read Japanese script, so she became responsible for the collection and was soon given free rein to begin collecting additional materials. In order to do this, Minami “traveled to Japan and China and purchased items from various smaller, private collections, acquiring the woodblock prints as well as hundreds of rare Chinese and Japanese medical texts, manuscripts, and painted scrolls.”<a href="./#_ftn2">[2]</a> Her collecting efforts spanned over 30 years, and produced a collection with over 10,000 titles. It would appear that Minami was still working at UCSF when <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378005349033&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=341&amp;q1=%22Atsumi%20Minami%22">this informative article</a> was written for a 1986 issue of <em>UCSF Magazine</em>.<a href="./#_ftn3">[3]</a> At the time that article was published, the East Asian medicine collection was also the only active collection of its kind in the U.S., making it even more notable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another woman who was influential in shaping the East Asian collection was Ilza Veith, a German medical historian and former UCSF professor in both the Department of the History and Philosophy of Health Sciences and the Department of Psychiatry. Veith, who in 1947 was awarded the first ever U.S. Ph.D.in the History of Medicine from Johns Hopkins University, was also awarded later, in 1975, the most advanced medical degree conferred in Japan, the <em>Igaku hakase, </em>from Juntendo University Medical School in Tokyo.  Veith was extremely knowledgeable about both Chinese and Japanese medicine, and, in her time at Hopkins, translated <em>Huang Ti Nei Ching Su Wen</em>, or <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2287209/">The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine</a></em> – the oldest known document in Chinese medicine. Though the text has somewhat mythical origins that make its author and date a little difficult to determine, it probably dates from around 300 BC. Veith also helped shaped UCSF’s East Asian medicine collection by donating a number of her Japanese medical books. </p>

<p>I would encourage anyone interested in the collection to browse the prints on <a href="https://japanesewoodblockprints.library.ucsf.edu/about.html">our website</a>, and to read more about their history via a <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3t1nc589/?query=UCSF+Japanese+Woodblock+Print+Collection">finding aid</a> on the Online Archive of California. Archives &amp; Special Collections also houses the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf9x0nb73d/?query=Veith+(Ilza)+Papers">Ilza Veith papers</a>. While we don’t yet have an Atsumi Minami collection, we welcome donations and would appreciate any information that the present-day UCSF community has about this amazing woman.</p>

<p>The Medical Heritage Library 10th Anniversary Conference took place on November 13, 2020. UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections staff attended the day of virtual presentations, and our Industry Documents Library archivists delivered a talk titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000*/http://www.medicalheritage.org/10th-anniversary-conference/#Tasker">&#8220;Smoke on Screens: Audiovisual Evidence of the Tobacco Industry&#8217;s Harms to Public Health.&#8221;</a></p>



<p>The conference was convened to celebrate a decade of digitizing and making available medical history resources. Keynote speaker Dr. Jaipreet Virdi, Assistant Professor for the Department of History at the University of Delaware, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240501000000*/http://www.medicalheritage.org/10th-anniversary-conference/#Virdi">presented her work on <em>Digitized Disability Histories</em></a>. She discussed disability identity as represented through material objects of disability, and examined how disability history is separate from medical history.</p>



<p>The program also included fascinating talks from nine other speakers, ranging from the rhetoric used in early 20th century motherhood manuals to medicalize infant care and degrade traditional knowledge, to using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify and label objects in historical images in order to visualize thematic collections at scale, to studying the historical lessons from popular culture and medical discourse of face masks during the 1918-1919 Flu epidemic.</p>



<p>All talks were recorded and are being made available with captioning on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Bda4jVpnefAqyVUwv1GPw" target="_blank">Medical Heritage Library YouTube channel</a> (see Session 2 for the &#8220;Smoke on Screens&#8221; talk).</p>



<p>The Medical Heritage Library (MHL) is &#8220;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/http://www.medicalheritage.org/mission-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a collaborative digitization and discovery organization committed to providing open access to the history of medicine and health resources</a>.&#8221; It was established in 2009 with a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to begin digitizing 50,000 medical history texts, and now includes more than 323,000 items made available by multiple contributors through an <a href="https://archive.org/details/medicalheritagelibrary?tab=collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">access portal on the Internet Archive</a>.</p>



<p>UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections is a contributing partner to the Medical Heritage Library. In 2015-2017 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blogs.library.ucsf.edu/broughttolight/2015/09/11/joint-project-to-digitize-state-medical-society-journals-1900-2000-funded/" target="_blank">A&amp;SC collaborated with four other medical libraries</a> to digitize and make publicly accessible state medical journals, funded by a $275,000 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant. 97 journal titles were digitized (nearly every state medical journal in the U.S.) resulting in over 2.7 million full-text searchable pages.</p>



<p>The Industry Documents Library has contributed over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://archive.org/details/industry-archives" target="_blank">5,000 video recordings</a> to the MHL, beginning in 2012. These videos are part of our <a href="https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/">Truth Tobacco Industry Documents</a> collection and include recordings of cigarette commercials, marketing focus groups, internal corporate meetings and trainings, depositions of tobacco company employees, and congressional hearings. The recordings document the industry&#8217;s marketing and public relations strategies to cast doubt on the harms of smoking and to prevent or delay public health regulations.</p>

<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services and Accessioning Archivist</p>



<p>We are currently more than halfway through Black History Month, a month that takes on special significance this year, following a summer of protests asserting, yet again, that Black Lives Matter. Archives &amp; Special Collections would be remiss if we failed to mention the groundbreaking Black faculty at UCSF, both past and present, who have made significant contributions to the fields of medicine and psychology (as well as many others), and, who, in their work, have found ways to illuminate new facets of racism previously unconsidered and who, on their paths to success, have also sought to support and lift up others.</p>



<p>Mindy Thompson Fullilove is a social psychiatrist who served as Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) from 1983 until 1990. Her work sits at the intersection of mental health and public health, and she focuses, in her own description, on the “sources and consequences of inequality, with a focus on the American city,” including segregation, gentrification, and the impact of these forces on the mental and physical health of Black families. <a href="./#_ftn1">[1]</a> She is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Black Family: Mental Health Perspectives </em>and <em>Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America and What We Can Do About It.</em><a href="./#_ftn2">[2]</a><em> </em>Most recently, she has co-edited a volume titled <em>From Enforcers to Guardians: A Public Health Primer on Ending Police Violence. </em>In 2018, she gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI2n2MJgoeA&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">TED talk</a> which gives an overview of her work and her personal history and outlines her hopes for achieving equality.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4614" width="286" height="330" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM.png 878w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM-259x300.png 259w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM-768x889.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /><figcaption>Mindy Thompson Fullilove</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Eritrean surgeon Haile T. Debas has, many times over, served as an example of what Black leadership can look like, and has shown how it can benefit others in a variety of ways. Debas, who came to UCSF in 1987 to serve as the Chair of the Department of Surgery, specializes in gastrointestinal physiology. During his time as Chair, UCSF “became one of the country&#8217;s leading centers for transplant surgery, the training of young surgeons, and basic and clinical research in surgery.”<a href="./#_ftn1">[3]</a> He then went on to serve as the Dean of the School of Medicine for 10 years, from 1993-2003. In 1997, he was appointed as the 7<sup>th</sup> Chancellor of UCSF, a position that he agreed to hold for one year while also serving as Dean of the School of Medicine.</p>

Debas, photo courtesy of UCSF University Relations</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Debas, in his long and distinguished career, has demonstrated a commitment to serving underserved areas, from his work in the Yukon Territories, where he practiced surgery early in his career, to a long-held dream of establishing a medical school in Eritrea. It was this commitment that led him to establish, in 2009, the UC Global Health Institute, which sought to leverage the expertise and resources of all ten UC campuses to address global health issues, which he says are “so big that single disciplines can’t tackle them.”<a href="./#_ftn1">[4]</a> He also served as Executive Director of UCSF Global Health Sciences (GHS), established in 2003, which focuses on issues like diseases of poverty, chronic illnesses, and the global threat posed by certain infectious diseases, like COVID-19.</p>



<p>His work in global health has informed his support for women’s empowerment movements, and he notes, “In global health, women’s empowerment is the critical element—nothing will be accomplished to a successful end without women’s support.”<a href="./#_ftn2">[5]</a> Debas also established the UCSF Department of Surgery’s Haile T. Debas Diversity Fellowship for Fourth Year Medical Students, which offers fourth year medical students a sub-internship in the Department of Surgery, as well as a $2,500 stipend.<a href="./#_ftn3">[6]</a>  Debas appears often in Archives &amp; Special Collections materials, as a part of the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/search~S0?/X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D/X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)/1%2C17%2C17%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;16%2C16%2C">Office of the Dean’s records</a>, as well as in the Global Health Sciences records and the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/search~S0?/X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D/X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(%22oral+history%22)/1%2C13%2C13%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;6%2C6%2C">Oral History collection</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, My name is Shannon Foley. I am incredibly excited to be interning at UCSF’s<br>Archives &amp; Special Collections this semester. I am currently in my last semester at the University of<br>San Francisco and will be graduating with a degree in Art History and Museum Studies.<br>Last semester I interned at the University of San Francisco’s Thacher Gallery. I helped<br>with their online exhibitions, a great experience learning how to navigate fully online<br>exhibitions.<br>At the University of San Francisco, the Art History and Museum Studies program offers<br>a diverse range of skills and experiences that I am excited to bring these skills to this<br>internship.<br>I grew up just an hour north of San Francisco in Sonoma County but have enjoyed<br>living in San Francisco for the past few years. When I am not in a class, I love to cook<br>and bake for my friends and family. I have also played tennis for the past ten years and<br>have enjoyed playing more during the pandemic. I am very passionate about traveling<br>and visiting museums abroad and locally.<br>On any given day, I can be seen walking my dog Louie and reading a good book.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that the <a href="https://calisphere.org/collections/2280/">UCSF Black Caucus Records</a> digital collection has added and updated descriptions for over 400 items. The collection documents the history of the UCSF Black Caucus, which began in 1968 to address the social inequalities and inequities at the University of California. It contains photographs, <a href="https://calisphere.org/item/f35111f8-2b87-458a-b060-013b61053350/">videos</a>, correspondence, publications, and meeting materials about the formation and activities of the Black Caucus. Some of the major events held by the UCSF Black Caucus include the protest to end of racism and discrimination at the University of California, the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Week and Black History Month programs, in conjunction with other campus organizations including the Women’s Resource Center, and annual Gala fundraisers.</p>

<p>A substantial portion of this incredible collection was complied, preserved, and donated to the archives by Elba Clemente-Lambert. Throughout the recent metadata enrichment project, she has painstakingly researched and provided more detailed descriptions of events and identification of individuals in photographs. Mrs. Clemente-Lambert collaborated with her UCSF colleagues and former Black Caucus members (now retirees) on what became a true crowdsourcing project that couldn’t have been successfully accomplished without her guidance and community support. (We will list the names of all people who supported this project in future blog posts). These additions will enable users to learn about the organization’s history, membership, leadership, and accomplishments.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="496" height="363" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Elba-Clemente-Lambert.jpeg" alt="Elba Clemente-Lambert sitting" class="wp-image-4593" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Elba-Clemente-Lambert.jpeg 496w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Elba-Clemente-Lambert-300x220.jpeg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Elba-Clemente-Lambert-410x300.jpeg 410w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /><figcaption>Elba Clemente-Lambert</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Elba Clemente-Lambert was born and raised in Spanish Harlem in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York. Mrs. Clemente-Lambert received her bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with a minor in Psychology from the City University of New York. She began her career in 1968 at UCSF as a Secretary II in the Department of Neurology. Then, she obtained an on-the-job training position (initiated by the efforts of the UCSF Black Caucus) in the Personnel Department (now Human Resources). Soon after joining the University of California, Elba became one of the <a href="https://calisphere.org/item/72949e03-3de4-4114-bb28-b080177a473a/">founding members</a> of the UCSF Black Caucus. She was elected to various positions in the Black Caucus’ Steering Committee, including Corresponding Secretary and Chair of the Publications Committee, as well as Member-at-Large<strong>.</strong> However, one of her most important positions was as “the unofficial, but official” photographer. Her passion for photography began in her high school journalism class, which stirred her belief that “we need to document what is occurring in our environment and beyond”. This dedication unintentionally led her to become a historian for the UCSF Black Caucus. Elba worked at UCSF until 1997 when she retired as a Senior Human Resource Specialist. In retirement, Elba continued to work occasionally with the UCSF Black Caucus while involved in the management of Creative Music Emporium (records store), established in April 1985 together with her late husband, first Black Officer hired at UCSF, Joseph G. Lambert, who decided to change his career after serving 18 years to become an entrepreneur in the music industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like to express our gratitude to all those who helped make this project possible: Mrs. Clemente-Lambert, Marisa McFarlane, and Charles Macquarie.</p>

<p>UCSF’s project supports a&nbsp;<a href="https://nnlm.gov/nacc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priority area for NLM and NIH</a>&nbsp;by digitizing approximately 45,000 pages from 15 archival collections related to the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the San Francisco Bay Area with the objective of making them widely accessible to the public. This project will chronicle the experience and struggles of communities of color and other marginalized communities during the onset of the AIDS epidemic.</p>



<p>This project will make publicly accessible experiences of communities that are “absent or excluded from the history of HIV/AIDS in the United States” [Jennifer Brier, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ohr/ohy003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;The Oral History Review</a>, Volume 45, Issue 1]. Its goal is to include the voices of underrepresented and marginalized groups in the historical record and increase public impact of these archival collections. These collections cover diverse issues communities are faced with: poverty, racial and socio-economic segregation, health care policy inequalities, public health and sexual education and prevention, disparities in the HIV response, the impact of HIV on migrant communities, and the intersection of the criminal justice system and HIV.</p>



<p>It will build on the success and expand the UCSF’s AIDS history digital collection that was developed with the assistance from the Implementation Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2017-2019 and <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/aids/documenting-aids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resulted in digitization of 160,197 pages from 35 archival collections from the three collaborating institutions</a>: UCSF, San Francisco Public Library (SFPL), and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society (GLBT HS).</p>

<p>The materials that will be digitized range from hand handwritten correspondence and notebooks to typed and printed reports and agency records. Photographic prints, negatives, transparencies, and posters will also be digitized. They will be added to a growing digital&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://calisphere.org/UCSF/items/?rq=AIDS" target="_blank">collection documenting the AIDS crisis</a>&nbsp;established by UCSF on the California Digital Library platform, <a href="https://calisphere.org/UCSF/collections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calisphere</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://dp.la/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA) becoming publicly accessible around the world. &nbsp;The materials will be digitized by the <a href="http://library.ucmerced.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UC Merced Library’s Digital Assets Unit</a> that has been partnering with UCSF on successful collaborative digitization projects for more than 10 years. All materials selected to be digitized will be carefully examined for privacy concerns and the archivists will consult with an existing Advisory Board.</p>



<p>UCSF plans to partner with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/" target="_blank">NLM’s History of Medicine Division</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dp.la/" target="_blank">DPLA</a>&nbsp;to create a collaborative AIDS history primary source set on the Digital Public Library of America in order to disseminate the project results and enable their educational use. UCSF will also promote the availability of this resource to organizations in the San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland, CA areas. This project is led by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/polina.ilieva" target="_blank">Polina Ilieva</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/ask-an-archivist/#archives-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edith Escobedo</a> serves as a project archivist.</p>

<p>Bishop is the recipient of numerous awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, including the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Biomedical Research and the American Cancer Society National Medal of Honor. In 1989, Bishop and his colleague, Harold E. Varmus, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that growth regulating genes in normal cells can malfunction and initiate the abnormal growth processes of cancer.In 2003, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. On July 1, 1998, J. Michael Bishop became eighth chancellor of UCSF, and presided over what would become the largest academic biomedical expansion in the nation-the creation of the UCSF Mission Bay campus. </p>

<p>Every October we celebrate Archives Month to reflect on the value of historical materials and to highlight UCSF Archives programs and services. This year we are marking the occasion in the midst of the era-defining triple pandemic of COVID-19, systemic racism, and police violence, not to mention momentous political upheaval.</p>



<p>Now as much as ever, it is critical to protect the records of the past and of the present. We are living through and making history; we must ensure that a diverse and inclusive record of this time is preserved for those in the future to access and understand.</p>



<p>Here are some ways you can get involved to celebrate Archives Month:</p>

<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services &amp; Accessioning Archivist</p>



<p>This coming Monday, September 28<sup>, </sup>2020, is the day UNESCO has designated as <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/accesstoinformationday?utm_source=ICA+Members+and+contacts+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=dfb0c50e3d-EMAIL_Newsletter_AUG_2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_84a7f06290-dfb0c50e3d-403675489">International Access to Information Day</a>. Their website notes that, this year, the day is focused on “the right to information in times of crisis and on the advantages of having constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information to save lives, build trust and help the formulation of sustainable policies through and beyond the COVID-19 crisis.” In a time of national and global crisis, this year’s theme may resonate particularly with Americans, whether it brings to mind the availability of voting information or attempts at voter suppression, or of the deliberate obfuscation of scientific data and fact by the highest levels of government.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, I’d like to celebrate libraries and archives, and their explicit mission to make information accessible. UCSF Library and its Archives &amp; Special Collections, though closed to the public since the City of San Francisco’s “shelter in place” mandate on March 16<sup>th</sup>, continues to find creative ways to help students, faculty, staff, and outside researchers access the vast stores of information that the library and archives hold, and to find ways to facilitate access across great distances.</p>



<p>As the User Services and Accessioning Archivist, my job is to both make collections accessible through the accessioning process, and to help users navigate the various portals through which Archives and Special Collections shares its information. This may be through finding aids on the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/institutions/UC+San+Francisco::Special+Collections">Online Archive of California</a>, catalog records in the <a href="https://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Library catalog</a>, or through <a href="///Users/Erin/Downloads/linton%20(1).pdf">brief inventories</a> attached to finding aids that tell a user what kinds of materials they can find in a given archival collection and to help them determine whether that particular collection may be of use to them.</p>



<p>Though the majority of my work is still remote, I have accessioned some exciting new collections on-site over the past couple of months, which will soon be available in the above-mentioned locations. Among these is an accrual to <strong>UCSF’s Black Caucus collection</strong>, focused on the Office of UCSF Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity and Diversity.&nbsp; The collection was donated to A&amp;SC in 2019, by Karen Newhouse, who served as Director of this office from 1970-2010, and includes materials documenting the work of various UCSF organizations committed to advancing diversity on campus, including Council of Minority Organizations (COMO), the Latin American Campus Association (LACA), and the pioneering Black Caucus organization, which was founded in May of 1968 – one month after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf538nb3k7/">finding aid</a> to the initial deposit notes, the organization is open to all Black women and men on campus, and “was instrumental in the establishment of an Affirmative Action Office, minority training programs and focused attention on the need for increased minority student enrollment at the UCSF campus.”</p>

<p>Another exciting addition to the UCSF Archives includes the <strong>papers of Benjamin Libet</strong> – a neurophysiologist and professor of physiology at UCSF for nearly 50 years. Very recently donated to the Archives by his daughter Moreen, Libet’s papers consist of his personal files of research into the human brain, as well as extensive documentation of his experiments attempting to locate the origin of “free will.” The “Libet Experiment,” as it has come to be called, was conducted in the 1980s, and tried to determine whether conscious decisions first originate in the body or in the brain by asking subjects to perform simple movements while measuring their brain activity. This study seemed to indicate that the brain registers the decision to make a movement before a person is consciously aware of the decision to move, suggesting that decisions may originate in the body, and, as some have suggested, possibly disproving the idea of “free will.” This assertion of physical determinism has been much debated, and Libet’s experiments continue to be of great interest. His papers include some of the experimental devices that were constructed to help measure these brain activities, as well as handwritten notes, graphs and diagrams, and the data produced over the course these experiments. The collection is still in the process of being accessioned and inventoried, but will be available soon via OAC and the Library catalog.</p>



<p>If you’d like to learn more about any of these collections, or have questions about A&amp;SC’s extensive <a href="https://calisphere.org/UCSF/collections/">digital collections</a>, please feel free to <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/ask-an-archivist/">get in touch</a>.</p>
