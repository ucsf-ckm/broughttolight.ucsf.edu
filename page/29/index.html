				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><em>This is a guest post by Dr. Selma Calmes</em></p>
<p>Arthur Guedel, MD (1883-1956), was an early anesthesiologist who made many important contributions to the development of anesthesiology.  His papers are now available at UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections.  Who was Dr. Guedel and why is he important?</p>
<p>Guedel’s early life was difficult.  He was born in Cambridge City, Indiana, and had to leave school at age 13 to help support his family.  A work accident led to the loss of the first three fingers of his right hand—and he was right-handed.  Guedel dreamed of practicing medicine even though he had no high school diploma and no financial resources.  American medical schools had few admission requirements then, and his family physician helped him get into the University of Indiana Medical School.  He graduated in 1908.<br />
Guedel administered his first anesthetics while an intern at Indianapolis City Hospital.  This was a common duty for interns of the time because there were then few physicians interested in anesthesia.  Guedel started a general practice in Indianapolis in 1909 and earned additional income by giving anesthesia in hospitals and dental offices.  He was an exceptional observer, analyzing carefully what might be going on with his anesthetized patients and thinking of possible solutions to the problems.</p>
<div id="attachment_1883" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1883" class="wp-image-1883 size-large" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GUEDEL-CHT1-791x1024.jpg" alt="GUEDEL CHT1" width="584" height="756" /><p id="caption-attachment-1883" class="wp-caption-text">First version of Guedel’s signs of anesthesia</p></div>
<p>One example of his contributions is his work on the signs of anesthesia.  The various devices that tell us how an anesthetized patients are doing today, such as EKGs, blood pressure devices and pulse oximeters, weren’t available when Guedel began to do anesthesia.   Four stages of anesthesia were accepted:<br />
Stage I: Induction, the start of administration until loss of consciousness<br />
Stage II: Struggling, breath-holding, delirium, from loss of consciousness to onset of surgical anesthesia<br />
Stage III: Surgical anesthesia, characterized by deep, regular, automatic breathing<br />
Stage IV: Bulbar paralysis, irregular breathing, pupils no longer respond to light</p>
<p>Guedel’s contributions were to expand these observations and to look for other physical signs.  He better defined Stage III, the level at which surgery could be done, by further dividing it into four planes and by adding eye signs. This improved patient safety by making clear when the patient was too “deep” and might possibly die from overdose of anesthesia.</p>
<div id="attachment_1881" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1881" class="wp-image-1881 size-full" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GUEDEL-PORTRAIT-200-e1433529521395.jpg" alt="GUEDEL PORTRAIT-200" width="400" height="592" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GUEDEL-PORTRAIT-200-e1433529521395.jpg 400w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GUEDEL-PORTRAIT-200-e1433529521395-203x300.jpg 203w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1881" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Arthur Guedel during World War I</p></div>
<p>The setting for these developments was Guedel’s service with the US Army in WW I in France.  The Army had no anesthesiologists when the US entered the war, and casualties were <span class="st">overwhelming</span>.  After working 72 hours straight along with three other physicians and one dentist, and needing to run as many as 40 operating room tables at a time, Guedel decided additional staff had to be trained.  He developed a school that taught physicians, nurses and orderlies to give anesthesia.  But, how could he help his trainees do safe anesthesia once they left the school?  He prepared a little chart of his version of the signs and stages of ether anesthesia, the most common agent in use at the time and one with a wide margin of safety.  This chart was a visual version of the concepts he had been developing before his Army service.  Armed with their charts, the trainees went out to nearby hospitals to work on their own.  Guedel acquired a motorcycle so he could make weekly rounds of the six hospitals for which he was responsible.  He would roar from hospital to hospital through the deep mud that characterized WW I battlefields, checking on his trainees.  He was known as &#8220;the motorcycle anesthetist&#8221; of WW I.<br />
After his return to the US in 1919, he presented his chart at meetings.  In 1920, he wrote an article on his signs for the first anesthesia journal. Additional articles appeared in 1935 and 1936 and also in Guedel’s notable book, <em><a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1111321~S0" target="_blank">Inhalation Anesthesia: A Fundamental Guide</a></em>, published in 1937.</p>

Chauncey Leake is standing above him</p></div>
<p>In 1929, Dr. Guedel moved from Indianapolis to Los Angeles.  He continued his careful observations and worked to solve important problems.  He collaborated with others, most importantly Dr. Ralph Waters of Madison-Wisconsin (considered the father of academic anesthesiology) and pharmacologist Dr. Chauncey Leake, then UCSF’s chairman of pharmacology.  Guedel would travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco for various research projects at UCSF. He even appears in the Bernard Zakheim murals at UCSF!   The papers now available in the UCSF Archives document many other contributions made by this important anesthesiologist.</p>
<p><em><strong>Selma Harrison Calmes, MD</strong></em> is a retired anesthesiologist interested in history. A 1965 graduate of Baylor College of Medicine, she trained in anesthesiology at the University of Pennsylvania. She came to UCLA in 1976 as their first pediatric anesthesiologist. In 1988, she became chair of anesthesiology at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. She retired from clinical work in 2007 and now is the Anesthesiology Consultant to the Los Angeles County Coroner.<br />
In 1980, she took a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Fellowship in Medical History at the University of Cincinnati under noted medical historian Dr. Sol Benison. She writes on various aspects of anesthesia history, especially in California, and on the many women who were early leaders in anesthesiology, especially Dr. Virginia Apgar. She co-founded the <a href="http://ahahq.org/" target="_blank">Anesthesia History Association</a> with Dr. Rod Calverley in 1982 and served as the first editor of their publication, now the <em><a href="http://www.anesthesiahistoryjournal.org/" target="_blank">Journal of Anesthesia History</a></em>. She is on the Board of Trustees of the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Wood Library-Museum and is president of the Guedel Memorial Anesthesia Center Board of Trustees. She appeared in the National Library of Medicine’s 2003-2005 exhibit on women in medicine, “Changing the Face of Medicine” and is listed in <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_52.html" target="_blank">their biographic dictionary</a>.</p>

			<p>The UCSF archives would like to announce the acquisition of the Arthur E. Guedel Anesthesia Collection. The agreement to transfer these unique materials of high research value that will complement existing archival holding was signed by the Arthur E. Guedel Memorial Anesthesia Center Board of Trustees and the UCSF Library last March. This extensive collection contains more than 40 linear feet of personal papers, rare books on the history and development of anesthesia, journals and artifacts, including anesthesia equipment and unique collection of artifacts from Richard Gill&#8217;s journey into Ecuador to collect curare, as well as audio-visual materials.</p>

<p>The Arthur E. Guedel Memorial Anesthesia Center was founded in 1963 by a small group of anesthesiologists who were interested in preserving the history of their specialty. The center is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Arthur E. Guedel, a pioneer of modern anesthesiology on the West Coast. For many years it was housed in the Health Sciences Library at California Pacific Medical Center and we are grateful to our colleagues there, in particular Anne Shew, director of the Health Sciences Library for an outstanding stewardship of these materials. The personal papers have detailed finding aids and after they are moved to the UCSF library later this summer, they will be made accessible to the visitors in the archives reading room. The reminder of the collection will be transferred to archives after removing duplicate material within a year. The Guedel collection materials will be incorporated into UCSF library catalog and archival collections finding aids describing the contents of personal papers will be added to the Online Archive of California. At the conclusion of the transfer, a Guedel collection digital portal describing history and materials in the collection will be built by the archives and linked to the <a href="http://anesthesia.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">UCSF Department of Anesthesia website</a>.<br />
Dr. Selma Calmes, retired Clinical Professor of Anesthesiology at UCLA and president of the Guedel Board of Trustees, noted in her 2004 article that Dr. Chauncey Leake, Professor of Pharmacology at UCSF was a person with strong ties to anesthesia and was instrumental in naming and organizing the center: “He suggested dedicating it to the memory of the only pioneer of modern anesthesia on the West Coast, Dr. Arthur Guedel of Los Angeles. Leake had been good friends with Guedel, who often visited UCSF to do research.” (1) The UCSF archives is the home of the <a href="http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf6w1008qz/" target="_blank">Leake papers</a> (as well as <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/search/c?SEARCH=[ANESTH]&amp;sortdropdown=-" target="_blank">collection of rare books on anesthesia</a>) and the addition of the Guedel collection will reunite these resources. It includes the papers and correspondence of several pioneers in the field on anesthesia, in particular, Richard C. Gill, Drs. Ralph Waters, Abram Elting Bennett, William Neff, and Arthur E. Guedel.</p>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the Guedel Board and in particular Drs. John Severinghaus, Merlin Larson, and Selma Calmes. Tomorrow we will be publishing a guest post written by Dr. Calmes and in the next year are planning to share updates about the transfer of the collection to UCSF, as well as showcase its treasures.<br />

<p>Come visit the UCSF Library and view our “sneak peek” exhibit on the history of the Radiologic Imaging Laboratory (RIL). The RIL was founded in the late 1970s by a team of UCSF scientists and engineers. The team&#8217;s goal was to create a clinically viable diagnostic tool using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, later called MRI. Over the course of 25 years, the lab developed innovative MRI technology that transformed the way doctors diagnose and treat patients worldwide.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.countryjoe.com/" target="_blank">Country Joe McDonald</a>, singer, songwriter, and social advocate, co-founder of <em>the Country Joe &amp; the Fish</em> rock band remembered for his performance in Woodstock, recently donated his Florence Nightingale collection to the UCSF archives. This International Nurses Day, May 12th, we asked Joe several questions about his unusual archive that contains 7 oversize boxes of printed materials, ephemera, and books as well as a website &#8220;<a href="http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/" target="_blank">Country Joe McDonald&#8217;s Tribute to Florence Nightingale</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>1. What got you interested in the life of Florence Nightingale?</strong></p>
<p>I heard Lynda Van Devanter, an Army Vietnam War nurse speak in 1981 at a symposium on the problems of Vietnam veterans. She challenged other veterans, saying we ignored the needs and service of women in the military. I took it to heart and promised her I would write a song for her. But I knew nothing of nursing except the name Florence Nightingale. I looked in the encyclopedia and it said Florence Nightingale had gone to nurse English soldiers at the request of the English government during the Crimean War in 1854. That she was an upper class woman and she suffered a nervous disorder for the rest of her life. Vietnam veterans were suffering from PTSD as a result of their experiences. I found this similarity  very interesting and wanted to know more. I went to a well known used book store in Oakland and found two books on her life. One was <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1143577~S0" target="_blank">Sir Edward Cook’s boo</a>k. The other, <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1002224~S0" target="_blank">Cecil Woodham-Smith’s book</a>. I read them both. And that was the beginning of my journey.</p>
<p><strong>2.       For how long have you been documenting her story?</strong></p>
<p>It was 1981 when I first heard Lynda speak, so it is over thirty years.</p>

<p><strong>3.       How do you select materials to add to your collection?</strong></p>
<p>At first it was not a collection. But I needed to learn about England and the Victorian Era in order to understand what I was reading.  So one thing led to another. Then I decided to visit the places important to her life. Wherever I went I would pick up stuff about the place I visited and her. She was such a huge social phenomena, such a famous person after the war, that lots of stuff was created about her and using her name. Since she was a recluse lots of it was just made up to satisfy the desire of the public to have a bit of her. She was famous on the level of Kim Kardashian or Princess Kate. I found this very interesting. So there was stuff that was intelligent and accurate and stuff that was pure fantasy and frivolous.<br />
I tried to get it all. I trolled Amazon and Internet book sites grabbing whatever I found that was not too expensive. Since I had a web person who was building my professional home page for me I decided to create a home page for her.  Using the facts and stuff I found out about her. We started with a time line of her life. It just grew and grew. It seemed to me to be endlessly interesting. I was amazed at the diversity of her life and nursing. I found it very hard to stop adding things.</p>
<p><strong>4.   What is your favorite item in this collection?</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to pick one item. But I will mention a copy I made of many of the pages of her third edition of <a href="https://archive.org/details/notesonhospital01nighgoog" target="_blank"><em>Notes On Hospitals</em></a>. I got an original through interlibrary loan from a library in Pasadena. Such a thing could never happen today. There are three editions of <em>Notes On Hospitals</em>. I have a facsimile of the original which is part of the collection. But the one always mentioned in writings about her is the third edition.</p>
<p>Much to my amazement the copy I got from inter library loan had a signature of Adelaide Nutting the famous nurse historian on the cover page. I felt like an archaeologist making a discovery. I guess the copy the library had once belonged to Adelaide Nutting. I probably could have just kept the copy and no one would have cared much. Such is the treatment Florence Nightingale is often given. She even predicted this. When the Edison Company recorded her voice she said that “some day when I am no longer a memory, just a name.” And today that is seems the case. Everyone knows her name but very little about her except the common folklore. I could not in good conscience keep the original. So I made copies of many of the pages. Even that would not be allowed today. And those pages are part of the collection.  Looking at those pages one sees what a theoretician, innovator and statistician she was.</p>
<p><strong>5.       You wrote several songs about nurses, where can we listen to them?</strong></p>
<p>I have had several ideas about how to tell the story of her life. I thought of a documentary called <em>“On The Trail Of Miss Nightingale”</em> where a host visited and talked about all the locations important to her life. Then, because I am a songwriter a few songs about her and nursing just came to me. Then I got the idea to write an opera about her life and wrote some more songs. Then I got the idea of a spoken word and song one man show about her life and nursing complete with projected slides. Then I tried to write a film treatment. A couple of the songs made it onto CD’s. I made a CD of four nurse songs called <em>&#8220;Thank The Nurse&#8221;</em> and still have a few of those around. I am currently working  on a new album and it will include several new songs about her and her sister. Over the years I have performed and talked about Florence Nightingale only a dozen times. I am amazed at the lack of song and film and about Florence Nightingale and nursing. Even though she is probably the most written about woman in history. She is never named as one of the famous and important women in the 20th century.</p>
<p>I think her image is tangled up in the convoluted thoughts and disinformation about women in general and nurses in particular. In today’s world there seems to be a lack of interest in history and an emphasis on the present and making a living. Perhaps that makes good common sense in today’s market place. But I still believe that her story is exciting, important and should be told.</p>
<p><strong>6.       Why did you decide to build a website telling the story of Florence Nightingale, what else does it include?</strong></p>
<p>It started as a simple idea. I wanted to show how interesting her life was and how important a person she was. We started with a timeline containing important events in her life from before her birth to her death. Each time I learned or discovered something new we added it. It is the only such site in the world. That just happened one thing at a time over a period of almost twenty years.  It is impossible for me to say what it includes. I will just say it includes everything I think is important to her life. You will not find some of that information any place else. I hope that UCSF Nursing School will continue to add to the site now that it is archived by the university.</p>
<p><strong> 7.       Do you know how many visitors it attracts?</strong></p>
<p>It is hard to interpret visitors to a site. But I will guess several hundred a month. Many of them are school children doing studies on famous women. I would be interested to know who uses the site. It was built for my own entertainment so I never had in mind visitors really.</p>
<div id="attachment_1842" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1842" class="wp-image-1842" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nurse_book_1963.jpg" alt="Cover of the book from Country Joe McDonald's Florence Nightingale collection, &quot;People at Work: The Nurse,&quot; 1963." width="348" height="526" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nurse_book_1963.jpg 400w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nurse_book_1963-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1842" class="wp-caption-text">Cover of the book from the Country Joe McDonald&#8217;s Florence Nightingale collection, &#8220;People at Work: The Nurse,&#8221; 1963.</p></div>
<p><strong>8.      Now that your collection and website are preserved at the UCSF Archives will you continue adding materials and updating the site?</strong></p>
<p>I doubt that I will add much more to the site. But you never know. It would be wonderful if UCSF students doing nurse history would add to the site. There is now a new generation growing up with the internet and computers and they certainly could expand the site.</p>
<p><strong>9.       For many years you have being performing a show based on the story of Florence Nightingale and other war nurses, where can our readers view it?</strong></p>
<p>There really is no where to view it. I thought over the years that there should be some film or video made so that it could perhaps be used as an educational tool but that never happened. I do not perform much any more. I did do a short performance of spoken word and song in a Berkeley book store a few months ago around the subject of War Nursing. That was the first time I did that. I used material from the Crimean War, World War I and the Vietnam War with a subject theme of “burn out.”</p>
<p><strong>10.  Do you have any nurses in your family?</strong></p>
<p>My wife is a Labor and Delivery nurse and RN midwife. My brother retired after 37 years as a nurse and then nurse practitioner. My daughter just graduated and received her RN license. My niece is a nurse at UCSF Hospital and her husband is an RN.  As an aside, my mother’s name was Florence. It is said that most of the women of the 19th and 20th century named Florence were named after her. She was named Florence after the Italian city of her birth, Florence .</p>
<p><strong>11. What do you want to wish the nurses around the world on this International Nurses Day that is celebrated on the birthday of Florence Nightingale?</strong></p>
<p>I hope that nurses are able to appreciate the great sacrifices that those early pioneers made creating the wonderful profession of nursing. I hope that they are able to be proud of the work they do. I want them to know that we appreciate what they do daily often saving lives and allowing us all to lead happy and healthy lives. And I hope that they are able to take the day off and treat themselves to some well earned R&amp;R.</p>

			<p><strong>In preparation for UCSF’s 150th anniversary celebration exhibits, we’ve been doing a bit of exploring in the vaults. For the next several months, I’ll be posting some of the treasures we’ve discovered!</strong></p>
<p>Check out the course registration process for UC Medical Department student Felix Bettelheim in 1878 and 1879. Forms included lecture admission tickets to courses in anatomy and surgery. The back of the tickets would be signed by the professor as a way to track attendance.</p>

<p>Bettelheim’s tuition looked a bit different than today. As noted in the receipt, it cost $3 to attend the assigned course of study. Bettelheim graduated in 1880, we hope debt free!</p>

<p>According to the United States Eye Injury Registry, each year there are more than 2.5 million eye injuries, from which 50,000 people permanently lose all or part of their vision, often leaving them severely disfigured. Through the centuries there had been many attempts to create safe, cosmetically pleasing and comfortable ocular prostheses. However, past devices were not designed well enough, fit poorly due to the gross sizing of the prosthetic samples and most of them were certainly irritating due to the use of unsuitable materials that were available at the time.</p>

<p>Often called the “father of ocular prosthesis,” French surgeon Ambroise Paré in 16th century invented a device (Ekblephara) consisting of a leather-covered metal base with a painted eye, lid and lashes that was worn over the eyelid. Later on, Paré developed a metal accessory (Hypoblephara eye) that was inserted under the eyelid into the socket over the remaining atrophic eye.</p>

<p>Modern methods of creating ocular prostheses can be traced to the ingenuity of Ludwig Müller-Uri, a Glasbläser (glassblower) from Lauscha, Province of Thuringia, Germany. The town’s craftsmen also were known for their Christmas glass decorations, glass marbles, utilitarian housewares and doll’s eyes. After training with Prof. Heinrich Adelmann, an ophthalmologist in Würzburg, Müller-Uri became an “Augenprothetik” (prosthetic eye-maker) or ocularist. He improved the artificial eyes by individually fitting each prosthetic. Müller-Uri created the iris details using special tools to apply the pigments he blended to most realistically resemble the natural eye. By 1835, he began using a better quality glass from the local factory. It was not until 1885 that the best cryolite glass became available, which was crucial for the patient’s tolerance of the prosthesis since they became lightweight, corrosion-resistant and more lifelike. It became the standard material for making ocular prosthetics and is still used in Germany, whereas acrylic plastic has replaced cryolite glass in the U.S.<br />
The Müller-Uri family working with the ophthalmologist from the Netherlands, Hermann Snellen designed the “Snellen eye” or “Reform-Auge” (“reform eye”) &#8211; prosthesis that consists of two connected shells with a hollow space between them and that can be worn by a patient with the enucleated eye.</p>

<p>During the 1880s, Amandus Müller manufactured approximately 13 eye-kits consisting of ocular pathology specimens &#8211; the hand-blown glass eye models depicting diseases. He sold the kits to European medical schools where they were used as teaching aids. Amandus Müller was a grand uncle of Gottlieb Theodore Danz, Sr. In 1915, Gottleib T. Danz, Sr. immigrated with his family to New York and brought one of his uncle’s kits to America. Later on, he moved his office to San Francisco. After the death of Gottlieb T. Danz, Sr., his widow gave that kit to her grandson, Phillip Danz (also an ocularist). In 1963, Phillip donated the kit to Professor Michael Hogan, MD, then Chairman of the UCSF Ophthalmology Department. Eventually the kit was given to the UCSF Archives, where it remains preserved today.</p>

It shows massive traumatic scleral and corneal lacerations, dislocation of the entire lens, severe inflammation and herniation of the vitreous gel.</p></div>
<p>This beautiful collection was exhibited several times during the past 50 years. However, many historic details about this donation were lost. The purpose of the upcoming lecture and comprehensive exhibit is to use this unique artifact to tell the story of family traditions continued through the centuries on two continents. Through partnership with several members of the Danz family &#8211; ocularists: Phillip Danz of Sacramento; William Danz of San Francisco; and William Randy Danz of Ridgewood, New Jersey; as well as the author/lecturer, Dr. Robert Sherins, ophthalmologist, UCSF School of Medicine Alumnus Class of 1963; and UCSF archivist, Polina Ilieva, this exhibit will demonstrate the evolution of skillful craftsmanship of Müller-Uri and Danz families, as well as the science and art of ocular prosthetics. The UCSF Library is grateful to the Danz Family and Dr. Sherins for their continuing support.</p>
