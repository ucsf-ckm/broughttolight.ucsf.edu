<p>Anida Hodzic is a senior undergrad at the University of San Francisco, who will be graduating in the fall, 2017. She was born in Bosnia and spent time in Berlin before moving to San Francisco.  She is majoring Art History and Arts Management with a minor in Classical Studies. She enjoys antiquity, from art to literature, with a strong interest in Greco-Roman culture and society. Before studying art history, she was working towards an International Business degree. Her time as a teacher&#8217;s assistant for her art history professor at City College of San Francisco helped her figure out that business was not her calling. Since then she has interned at Schein &amp; Schein, an antique map and rare book gallery. Currently she is looking forward to delving into historical medical artifact at UCSF. She is extremely excited to spend time at the UCSF archives and hopes to soak up as much information as possible. Anida will be designing and building the online component for the archives exhibit, <em>University of California Medical Service in World War I.</em></p>

			<p><em>This is a guest post by Zach Bleemer. Zach is a Research Associate at UC Berkeley’s Center for Studies in Higher Education, where he directs the University of California Cliometric History Project, and a Graduate Intern in Institutional Research and Academic Planning at the UC Office of the President. </em></p>
<p>A few months ago, I gave a lecture entitled “<a href="https://archive.org/details/HigherEdCA_BigDataApproach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A History of Higher Education in California: A Big Data Approach</a>” at the UCSF Archives. The lecture presented a large trove of newly-collected UC student records from the first half of the 20th century, including a complete register of University of California undergraduate and graduate students—their names, home towns, degrees, and years of graduation—from 1893 to 1946. These records enable descriptive analysis like Figure 1, which extends well-documented trends in college major selection back to the late 19th century (for UC Berkeley).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3214" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/COH_bleemer_01.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="575" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/COH_bleemer_01.jpg 618w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/COH_bleemer_01-300x240.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/COH_bleemer_01-375x300.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/UCHealth-a-century-of-health.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topic Brief published by the Institutional Research and Academic Planning Group (IRAP) at the UC Office of the President</a> integrated this historical data with contemporary records of UC-trained medical professionals. Figure 2 uses California state medical license records from 1920 and 2016 to map the towns in which UC-trained doctors practice medicine, color-coding the towns by the doctors’ gender. Between 10 and 15 percent of UC medical students in the first decade of the 20th century were women, but women accounted for more than half of UC medical students in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>

<p>We also published an <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive map feature</a> displaying the more than 850 cities and towns in which health professionals—doctors, dentists, optometrists, and veterinarians—trained by the University of California since 1999 currently practice, including both former graduate students as well as former residents (constructed by merging student and employment records with 2016 state licensing records). Toggles allow the viewer to restrict the map by UC campus, professional discipline, ethnicity, and level of training, and the map is color-coded by the professionals’ gender. The map displays both the demographic and geographic diversity of UC’s health-oriented graduates, who work in more than 60 percent of California towns with any health professionals. The interactive display also includes bar charts showing the number of health professionals who graduated UC each year (by campus and demographic group).</p>

<p>Both of these projects are part of a new initiative, <em>A Century of Health</em>, which aims to visualize and analyze the long-run contributions of UC’s health-oriented graduate schools to the state of California and beyond. Future components of this initiative will extend to pharmacists, nurses, physicians assistants, and more, and will leverage both new and very old sources of data, partly thanks to the UCSF Archives. The most exciting and comprehensive source of data is historical student transcripts housed in the UCSF Registrar, which we have recently concluded digitizing. A Century of Health aims to provide new insight into the University of California’s role in fostering wellness, economic mobility, and gender/ethnic equality across California by expanding, deepening, and repackaging information detailing the ubiquity of the University of California’s health-oriented graduate schools.

			<p>This is part 1 of a series of blog posts we will put together talking about some of our web-archiving activities at UCSF, and examining some of the changes in University web presences over the years we’ve been collecting them. How many parts will there be? We don’t know yet! The possibilities are endless, so we’ll just have to see where it takes us.</p>
<p>By way of some introduction, we here at Archives &amp; Special Collections have been collecting website captures since about 2009. Initially we used a service maintained by California Digital Library called WAS (Web-Archiving Service), but we now use the Internet Archives <a href="https://archive-it.org/"><em>Archive-It</em></a> service to capture sites. We plan to use a later post to go into more detail about how <em>Archive-It</em> works, but for this blog post it suffices to know that Archive-It contains the technology that crawls the web-sites and saves them on the Internet Archives servers just down the road at their Clement St. headquarters.</p>
<p>So why do we do this? Currently, much of the history of the University and its various buildings, people, and internal organizations are all published on the web, so examining that history in the future will include looking at these web-sites to assess the way things have changed.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s look at the web page for Synapse, the UCSF Student Newspaper. Even since 2009, we can see significant changes in the look and feel of the web page, and can begin to tease out historical questions from the design and content of the pages.</p>
<div id="attachment_3190" style="width: 1436px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3190 size-full" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02.png" alt="" width="1426" height="600" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02.png 1426w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02-300x126.png 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02-1024x431.png 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02-768x323.png 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2009-01-02-500x210.png 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3190" class="wp-caption-text">Synapse home page in 2009.

It&#8217;s gone through a redesign, and perhaps looks a bit more like a newspaper now. It also contains some interesting pre-formatted search bars at the top right.</p></div>
<p>Already questions begin to emerge. Why did the staff institute search starting in 2011? And did the interesting &#8220;How Do I?&#8221; pre-formatted search bar get added to the page as a result of identified need for such searches? (I had never seen it before this)</p>
<div id="attachment_3189" style="width: 1518px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3189" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19.png" alt="" width="1508" height="816" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19.png 1508w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19-300x162.png 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19-1024x554.png 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19-768x416.png 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2013-01-19-500x271.png 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1508px) 100vw, 1508px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3189" class="wp-caption-text">Synapse home page in 2013.

<div id="attachment_3191" style="width: 1449px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3191" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21.png" alt="" width="1439" height="906" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21.png 1439w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21-300x189.png 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21-1024x645.png 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21-768x484.png 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2015-02-21-476x300.png 476w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1439px) 100vw, 1439px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3191" class="wp-caption-text">Synapse home page in 2015. It retains the same look, appears to have moved to a new slideshow technology, and just so happens to feature Dr. Atul Butte at the very beginning of his current position at the University.</p></div>
<p>Between 2013 and 2015 the paper got a new look for its home page, and introduced slide shows for the first time. Additionally the paper gained a &#8220;login&#8221; option in 2013 but that had been removed again by 2015 — perhaps a brief memory of the everything-must-be-social media phase of design. It&#8217;s also the first time that advertisements have appeared directly on the front page of the paper.</p>
<p>In these documents we can also begin to see the rise of precision medicine and computational health sciences at UCSF, and it&#8217;s clear that by 2015 the University was ramping up investment, and that this translated directly to the content of the newspaper as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_3192" style="width: 1583px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3192" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22.png" alt="" width="1573" height="879" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22.png 1573w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22-300x168.png 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22-1024x572.png 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22-768x429.png 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22-1536x858.png 1536w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Synapse_2017-05-22-500x279.png 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1573px) 100vw, 1573px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3192" class="wp-caption-text">Synapse home page in 2017. It now reflects the design we are used to with most sites we visit.</p></div>
<p>And finally the page today is in line with much of the design we are used to seeing at our most commonly-visited sites. Synapse also happens to be going back to the archives themselves in this latest update, and pulling content which is just distant enough to have a historical feel.</p>
<p>The aesthetic changes in the page also mirror the aesthetic trajectories of the way we think health and the health sciences should &#8220;look&#8221;. It makes sense that they&#8217;ve gone back to a mostly white color scheme — you&#8217;d have a hard time finding a contemporary web page for a hospital or health provider with a dark color scheme now.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to consider web pages as historical artifacts because we are so close to them, but we are now reaching a point where the first web pages we have collected look foreign enough to us that they are beginning to seem more worthy of study. And we&#8217;ve barely even mentioned the wealth of data about the way we communicate which is contained in our web-archives and which can be accessed and assessed with new computational historical methods.</p>
<p>You can find all the UCSF web-archives here: <a href="https://archive-it.org/organizations/986">https://archive-it.org/organizations/986</a></p>
<p>What research will you do with them?</p>

			<p><em>This is a guest post by Cristina Nigro, UCSF History of Health Sciences graduate student and curator of the UCSF Archives WWI exhibit.</em></p>
<p>Each year on the last Monday of May, our nation commemorates U.S. service members from all wars who died while on active duty. On this Memorial Day we pay special homage to the servicemen and women of World War I, as 2017 marks the centennial anniversary of the U.S. entrance into WWI.</p>
<div id="attachment_3155" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3155" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mss705_1_scrapbook_Elbridge-Best.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="803" /><p id="caption-attachment-3155" class="wp-caption-text">Elbridge Best. From the John Homer Woolsey papers, MSS 70-5, box 1, photograph album.</p></div>
<p>Dr. Elbridge Best, graduate of the UC Medical School class of 1911 who later joined the UCSF faculty, served in WWI at Base Hospital No. 30 in Royat, France. Base Hospital No. 30 was organized by the UC Medical School in March 1917—the month <em>before</em> President Woodrow Wilson asked a joint session of Congress to request a declaration of war with Germany. <a href="https://archive.org/details/cum_000057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a 1964 interview, </a>Best recalled the early mobilization effort by him and his colleagues who “felt that the war was imminent” and who “were a little concerned with regard to the possible slowness of the White House deciding to declare war.”</p>
<div id="attachment_3156" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3156" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/mss705_1_scrapbook_officers-march.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="367" /><p id="caption-attachment-3156" class="wp-caption-text">Officers and enlisted personnel. From the John Homer Woolsey papers, MSS 70-5, box 1, photograph album.</p></div>
<p>Before leaving for the front, Best was put to work in the aviation unit established in San Francisco. He helped to medically examine applicants for the aviation corps in the summer and fall of 1917. Best was later transferred from the aviation unit to the Presidio in San Francisco. There, he &#8220;did regular duty until the mobilization of the Base Hospital 30 in November when we then stopped our other activities, lived as a unit until the transportation was arranged and we boarded the ship at Fort Mason to proceed down the west coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unit arrived in New York harbor in March 1918, staying at Camp Merritt for about a month before embarking on the journey abroad. Best recalled his experience with an influenza epidemic in New York at the time: &#8220;Many of the Army men were taken to the Rockefeller hospital for treatment. And each of the cases where fluid was found in the chest the procedure was to immediately insert a needle and draw the fluid. It became very evident that whenever we saw this done we would say to a friend that we will see this body in the morgue the next morning. So many of these boys died following the removal of the acute fluid that when we went to France we made it a rule never to draw any fluid off until after we were sure there was frank pus and it should be treated surgically. The result was that we lost none of those cases which were the cause of the high mortality at the Rockefeller hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>The staff of Base Hospital No. 30 arrived in Royat, France in May 1918. Best remembered that casualties were sent to the hospital soon after the unit arrived: &#8220;They came almost as soon as we had most of our material unpacked&#8230;.The casualties from the front came down to us on trains, Red Cross trains, arranged with beds. And we removed the patients from the trains by way of the windows ordinarily. The one train was full of gas injuries, phosgene and mustard gas. Another trainload came all shot-up which the debridement had been done at the front. These trains ordinarily did not have mixed cases—they were usually all of one type—and they usually contained from four to five hundred wounded at a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Best recalled suddenly learning of the armistice on November 11, 1918: &#8220;Everybody was elated and as soon as the evening meal was over on that day, all of those who were not on duty went the three kilometer distance to Clermont-Ferrand to celebrate this notable event&#8230;After the armistice, some of us had the privilege of visiting French families in various country areas&#8230;We would go and have tea with a certain family or we would have dinner with some people or they would have a reception in which French and American people in the vicinity would appear. I am particularly reminded of one French family we visited in a lovely, old-style two story wooden home on a farm&#8230;These people spoke no English and we had to converse in French. And the philosophy, the problems, the day-by- day incidents that these people would gossip with us about were exactly the same as those that we would encounter among families in similar positions in the United States. The only difference between these delightful people and the people in our homes were that they spoke French and we spoke English.&#8221;</p>

UCSF Archives and the UCSF History of Health Sciences Graduate Program honor their legacy with an exhibit, <em>“DO THE BEST FOR OUR SOLDIERS”: University of California Medical Service in World War I</em>, on display now on the main floor of the UCSF Library, 530 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, through April 2018.

<p>The UCSF Archives and Special Collections is pleased to announce the opening of a new exhibit at the UCSF Library,<em> “DO THE BEST FOR OUR SOLDIERS:” University of California Medical Service in World War I. </em> The exhibit commemorates the centennial anniversary of US involvement in World War I and recognizes the service of UCSF doctors, nurses and dentists at Base Hospital No. 30 in Royat, France. It also highlights the war-related research and care provided by UCSF scientists, clinicians, and healthcare workers in San Francisco and abroad.</p>
<p>Join UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections for guided tours of the exhibit and an afternoon talk with Drs. Morton G. Rivo and Wen T. Shen. Dr. Shen will speak on the biography of Dr. Howard C. Naffziger. Lieutenant Colonel Howard C. Naffziger, a prominent neurosurgeon before the war, served in the Army Medical Corps in France and at home, as Chief of the Neuro-Surgical Service at the U.S. Army Letterman General Hospital located in the Presidio. Naffziger became the Chair of the first Department of Neurosurgery at the University of California in 1947.</p>

<p>In April 1917, when America formally entered World War I, the United States Army had 86 dental officers, the US Navy, even fewer. Dr. Rivo will discuss the contributions of the UCSF Medical and Dental Schools that helped to quickly establish extensive dental/maxillofacial services on the Home Front and with the American Expeditionary Forces in France. He will address the role of dentists and oral surgeons, both in the US as the military mobilized, and in France, during the ensuing brutal year and a half of combat which terminated in November 1918.</p>
<p>This exhibit was curated by Cristina Nigro, graduate student from the History of Health Sciences  Program, UCSF Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/" target="_blank">Archives and Special Collections department </a>of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Library, in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.sfpl.org" target="_blank">San Francisco Public Library (SFPL)</a> and the <a href="http://www.glbthistory.org" target="_blank">Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender (GLBT) Historical Society</a>, has been awarded a $315,000 implementation grant from the <a href="http://www.neh.gov" target="_blank">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>. The collaborating institutions will digitize about 127,000 pages from 49 archival collections related to the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the San Francisco Bay Area and make them widely accessible to the public online. In the process, collections whose components had been placed in different archives for various reasons will be digitally reunited, facilitating access for researchers outside the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The 24-month project, “The San Francisco Bay Area’s Response to the AIDS Epidemic:  Digitizing, Reuniting, and Providing Universal Access to Historical AIDS Records” will commence on July 1, 2017. The 127,000 pages from the three archives range from handwritten correspondence and notebooks to typed reports and agency records to printed magazines. Also included are photographic prints, negatives, transparencies, and posters. The materials will be digitized by the <a href="http://library.ucmerced.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Merced Library&#8217;s Digital Assets Unit</a>, which has established a reputation for digitizing information resources so that they can be made available to the world via the web. All items selected for digitization will be carefully examined to address any privacy concerns. The digital files generated by this project will be disseminated broadly through the California Digital Library, with the objects freely accessible to the public through both <a href="https://calisphere.org/" target="_blank">Calisphere</a>, operated by the University of California, and the <a href="https://dp.la/" target="_blank">Digital Public Library of America</a>, which will have an AIDS history primary sources set.</p>
<p>&#8220;A digital repository of 127,000 pages from 49 collections from these three institutions not only allows the collections to ‘speak’ to one another in novel ways, but makes them accessible to a broad array of audiences.  Within academia, historians of medicine and public health will be joined by sociologists and historians of gender, sexuality, and journalism, for starters.  They will be eager to make such remarkable primary source materials available to undergraduate, graduate, and medical students alike.  But such materials have a far wider potential audience,&#8221; said Scott H. Podolsky, M.D., Professor of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.</p>
<p>Haipeng Li, University Librarian, University of California, Merced Library stated that &#8220;the UC Merced Library is very pleased to be partnering on this project, which builds upon our long-standing collaboration with UCSF Library to digitize rare and unique materials in the health sciences. Our students and researchers, especially those involved in UC Merced’s growing public health program, will benefit from wider access to the AIDS history materials and I am sure the experience and expertise of our staff will enable them to contribute significantly to the success of the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AIDS epidemic became one of the most significant public-health events of the late-twentieth century, continuing into the twenty-first. San Francisco was particularly hard hit by AIDS, in part because, by the early 1980s, it had become a welcoming place for gay men who moved from throughout the country and around the world to experience a flourishing community. This same diaspora also fueled, early on in the crisis, the development of unique community-based organizations (CBOs) to care for the sick and dying. At the same time, the AIDS crisis engendered unprecedented modes of political activism. Desperate people with HIV/AIDS and their allies hoping for a cure, held protests and sit-ins at medical conferences and became respected colleagues in the search for effective treatments while demanding early access to therapies, shaking up the staid world of medical research. Art and literature, too, most notably the AIDS Quilt, were created out of the grief and loss caused by the epidemic.  Beginning in the mid-1980s, San Francisco witnessed the development of a highly effective collaborative network of city and state agencies, hospitals, health care providers, and CBOs that, through a goal of putting patients first, became known as the “San Francisco model” of compassionate AIDS care.</p>
<p>&#8220;The early years of the AIDS epidemic are just over the historical horizon for many who will themselves be forced to wrestle with issues of disease stigmatization and the blurred domains between medicine and society.  These are our future patients, clinicians, politicians, and policymakers alike.  It is thus important that such collections &#8211; documenting a central, if difficult, part of our nation&#8217;s history &#8211; be exposed to as wide a public as possible,&#8221; said Podolsky.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, UCSF initiated, with the GLBT Historical Society and other Bay Area archives, the AIDS History Project, addressing the need to forge relationships between historians and the AIDS community to document and preserve the lessons and experience of the AIDS epidemic. Today UCSF, the GLBT Historical Society, and SFPL archivists have selected collections from each archive that will contribute to an understanding of the medical, social, and political processes that merged to develop effective means of treating those with AIDS, educate the public about HIV, create social support organizations for those who were often shunned by family, and advocate for a community that was dying at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Terry Beswick, Executive Director of the GLBT Historical Society explained, &#8220;We were founded in 1985 in San Francisco, at a time when it was becoming increasingly apparent that AIDS was threatening the historical memory of the LGBTQ community. In fact, we lost many of our founders and supporters to AIDS &#8211; and many are living with HIV today. That’s why this project is especially important to us. AIDS and, more importantly, the San Francisco Bay Area&#8217;s response to the epidemic, have been both the catalyst for our formation and one of our main historical influences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The San Francisco Public Library houses both the City and County of San Francisco city archives and the James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center, the first research center for GLBT collections in a public library in the country. In its role as the repository of the city archives, the library receives collections from politicians, including mayors, as well as from city departments, many addressing policy decisions and the creation of the &#8220;San Francisco model&#8221; in response to the devastation of the AIDS epidemic,&#8221; said Luis Herrera, San Francisco City Librarian. &#8220;Not only will the proposed collaborative project allow greater access to primary source materials that are located only in San Francisco, but it will ensure that these items are digitally preserved for long lasting use. We also welcome the opportunity to &#8220;reunite&#8221; collections that were given to multiple institutions in separate donations over time or from different donors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rarely in the history of human societies has there been an opportunity to capture information in real time about a new disease that became a pandemic. The story is multi-focal: the medical response, the cultural response, the political response, and the caregiving response&#8221;, said Victoria A. Harden, Founding Director Emerita, Office of NIH History.</p>
<p>Providing online access to the digital archival collections will benefit a diverse group of users, including scholars in disciplines such as history, literature, medicine, jurisprudence, journalism, and sociology; college and university students in an equally broad range of fields; media outlets; and members of the general public.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful to think that a future researcher could, at the click of a button, shift quickly from Shilts’s book to his handwritten interview notes, to Selma Dritz’s slides about venereal disease, to the diary pages of Daniel Turner or Bobbi Campbell, or to the administrative records of the institutions involved &#8211; records which are currently geographically distant, despite having been tightly connected thematically in the past,” said Richard A. McKay, D.Phil., a Wellcome Trust Research Fellow in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>The project team has established a five-member Advisory Board that will be available to consult with project team members as needed to asses and resolve issues related to sensitive materials in the collections. Members include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbara A. Koenig, PhD, RN, Professor of Medical Anthropology &amp; Bioethics in the Department of Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, Institute for Health &amp; Aging and Head of UCSF Bioethics Program</li>
<li>Phoebe Evans Letocha, Collections Management Archivist at Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions</li>
<li>Jeffrey Reznick, PhD, chief, History of Medicine division at National Library of Medicine</li>
<li>Paul Volberding, Professor of Medicine, UCSF; Director, AIDS Research Institute; Director, Global Health Sciences Research; Co-Director, UCSF-GIVI Center for AIDS Research</li>
<li>Elizabeth Watkins, PhD, UCSF Dean of the Graduate Division, Vice Chancellor &#8211; Student Academic Affairs, and Professor in the Department of Anthropology, History, and Social Medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>“UCSF and affiliated faculty and staff including those at Zuckerberg San Francisco General, played a leading role in responding to the horrendous HIV epidemic. The experiences of that response and the lessons learned that can help guide future challenges demand we collect and preserve documents from those early days.&#8221; said Paul Volberding, Director, AIDS Research Institute; Director, Global Health Sciences Research; Co-Director, UCSF-GIVI Center for AIDS Research. &#8220;We are thrilled that the UCSF Archives along with our partners at the SF Public Library and the GLBT Historical Society has received grant funding to support this process. We are certain that this archive will be a powerful research tool for historians as they help us better understand our contributions. The <a href="https://ari.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">UCSF AIDS Research Institute </a>is eager to do all we can to help this vital resource.”</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the project, public access to the materials will be launched in a variety of ways. The availability on Calisphere and Digital Public Library of America will be promoted online, and the content of the collection will be explored through exhibits and public programs at each of the collaborating institutions, including at UC Merced. Finally, to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the 1989 “AIDS and the Historian” conference, a national conference on the history of the response to the AIDS epidemic will be presented in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“NEH provides support for projects across America that preserve our heritage, promote scholarly discoveries, and make the best of America’s humanities ideas available to all Americans,” said NEH Chairman William D. Adams. “We are proud to announce this latest group of grantees who, through their projects and research, will bring valuable lessons of history and culture to Americans.”</p>

			<p><em>Post by Charlie Macquarie, UCSF Archives Digital Archivist</em></p>
<p>I spent most of last week down the peninsula for the convening of the <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/personal-digital-archiving-2017">Personal Digital Archiving (PDA)</a> conference, now in its 7<sup>th</sup> year, and left with some fascinating thoughts and conversations in my mind. PDA “seeks to host a discussion across domains focusing on how to best manage personal digital material, be it at a large institution or in a home office.” As a result of this focus, it also ends up playing host to all kinds of fascinating new practices and approaches to collecting, preserving, providing access to, and even <em>thinking about</em> personal digital information.</p>
<div id="attachment_3082" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3082" class="size-medium wp-image-3082" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_5537-220x300.jpg" alt="archivists use smart phones to photograph an 8 inch floppy disk reader. " width="220" height="300" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_5537-220x300.jpg 220w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_5537.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3082" class="wp-caption-text">A moment from the Born-Digital Archiving pre-PDA meetup, where archivists hover around a computer built to read 8 inch floppy disks &#8212; an almost impossible task these days</p></div>
<p>The conference covered a huge range of work, and included presentations on different ways to conceptualize digital space (screenshots, video game emulations, the list goes on), projects seeking to allow communities to directly transfer their digital materials to a library collection through apps or interfaces, and even a fascinating assessment of the way that teens store and access information about their personal finances (including the clincher that almost all ages show a tendency to simply discard financial information after a stated financial goal has been reached). Also included were some updates on the sustainability (or lack of it) of some of the field’s pioneering digital archives projects, like the <a href="https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:cksgv/pdf/">Salman Rushdie papers at Emory University</a> (hint, it’s still people, not machines, that are making it run).</p>
<p>Some presentations particularly interesting to a health sciences institution like our own were those on the self-collection and assessment of health and other biometric data espoused by the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> movement. Quantified Self is a loosely-organized group who collect and store data about themselves, and then use various computational and creative methods to analyze that data  for self-insights framed as citizen science.</p>
<div id="attachment_3083" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3083" class="size-medium wp-image-3083" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-300x282.jpg" alt="A slide shows in a darkened room as a person gives a presentation on &quot;QS&quot; or Quantified Self." width="300" height="282" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-300x282.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-1024x964.jpg 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-768x723.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-1536x1446.jpg 1536w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS-319x300.jpg 319w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/QS.jpg 1773w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3083" class="wp-caption-text">Gary Wolf gives the keynote on the Quantified Self movement.</p></div>
<p>Quantified Self (the formal organization) has just embarked on its first experiment to facilitate participants testing and analyzing their own blood, which has brought up a host of questions on the ethics of collecting and making public one’s own health data. Additionally, the project raises questions about the freedoms and constraints that tend to coalesce around these projects of “do it yourself” self-quantification (not to mention the often neglected questions around power and privilege that tinge the conversation around collection of, access to, and work with self-referential data). The approach taken by quantified self practitioners is surely different than ours here in the archives, but we still face similar issues as archivists in a health-sciences university, where historical information mixes with personal narrative and private health data – both in the legal sense and the intimate emotional sense as well.</p>
<p>This forum was a fascinating opportunity to dig a bit deeper into the ideologies and practices behind the collection and preservation of personal digital material, and it seemed fitting that these questions were being explored in dialogue with all the people in the room. One of the biggest takeaways from the conference, after all, was that the tools and technologies to facilitate this work are often the focus of the intrigue and excitement, but that it’s the people who dedicate their time and resources to the endeavor that keep the whole thing running. Just as the Salman Rushdie Digital Collection requires the work of a cadre of dedicated digital archivists at Emory, the future of our digital past will require serious work by a broad and diverse community of archivists, technologists, historians, fanatics, and citizens.</p>
<p>One of the final audience comments was prescient in this regard: “it seems like what might be missing is a discussion of privilege in these projects.” Indeed, any community of practice is unlikely to persist for long if it doesn’t contain a diversity of interests.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been a busy start to spring here at UCSF A&amp;SC: new events and exhibits coming up, lots of researchers, and of course many new collections. As is prone to happen during times like these, there is a pile of new materials sitting on my desk, just waiting for me to enter into our database and (eventually) our library catalog. Here are a few that I am particularly excited about:</p>
<p><strong>Clark Sturges papers (MSS 2017-09)</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3067" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mss2017-09_1_1_cover.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="671" /></p>
<p>Just in time for the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, we recently were given the papers of Clark Sturges that relate to his <a href="http://www.drdave.org/Articles/BookDrDave_The-Book.htm">profile</a> of Dr. David E. Smith. Smith founded the Haight Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in 1967 in response to the medical needs of many of the young people who came to San Francisco during the Summer of Love. Sturges completed the book in 1993, and the papers are composed mainly of taped interviews, research notes, and correspondence.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Deeks papers (MSS 2017-10)</strong></p>

<p>Another recent acquisition is the papers of Dr. Steven Deeks. The Deeks papers are primarily concerned with his involvement in the controversial <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/15/us/man-gets-baboon-marrow-in-risky-aids-treatment.html?pagewanted=all">baboon bone marrow transplant</a> to an AIDS patient in 1995. While the transplant was not successful, it illustrates the sense of desperation of people with AIDS at that time&#8211;and also the highly innovative approaches that UCSF and SFGH doctors and researchers were taking at that time to combat the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Jacobson papers (MSS 2017-12)</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3069" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mss2017-12_1_triomune30.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="710" /></p>
<p>Finally, another collection that recently found its way to my desk is the papers of Dr. Mark Jacobson. The Jacobson papers are a hodgepodge of different materials, including calendars, index cards with patient symptoms and medication, a multitude of electronic records (including his PalmPilot), and this <a href="http://www.forbesindia.com/article/leadership-awards-2016/yk-hamied-ciplas-fearless-crusader/44893/1">Triomune 30</a> box, which he picked up on a trip overseas. Dr. Jacobson also gave us a substantial number of books for our burgeoning AIDS History collection, and recently wrote a <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b2319995~S0">novel</a> based upon his experiences that mentions the patient index cards in its <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gx2rDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mark+Jacobson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl8rvO2fzSAhUE_mMKHYA9ApoQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=index%20cards&amp;f=false">foreword</a>.</p>
