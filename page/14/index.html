			<p><em>This is a guest post by our Digital Archives intern for summer 2018. The intern worked on implementing, testing, and piloting equipment for the Digital Forensics Lab to capture content off of decaying computer media which are present in our collections. </em></p>
<p>This summer I worked with UCSF’s Digital Archivist Charles Macquarie on building up the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections Digital Forensics Lab. It was such an honor to come and join the UCSF team because of the great people, and the unique and important collections that the Archives preserves and provides access to. I am grateful for the experience and the shared wisdom of the staff, and to be able to contribute to this growing piece of the work of the Archives.</p>
<p>What exactly does it mean to build a Digital Forensics Lab? In the case of UCSF, many of the collections contain obsolete and legacy media – things like floppy disks and ZIP disks, and even personal digital assistants (PDAs, remember those pre-smart phone devices?) and SD cards. As more time passes, it isn’t so easy to read or utilize these formats effectively without access to the machines and software that are used to read and create them.</p>
<p>Without access, we risk losing important parts of collections when outdated digital document formats and research materials become no-longer readable. By creating a lab environment where we can rescue these items, we can give them life again. This is why I love this kind of work.</p>
<p>Building a lab like this is no small challenge! I’ve worked on configuring new software to power old hardware, testing lab equipment with “dummy disks” and files, troubleshooting the problems that arise with new implementation, and even building a new housing for a few select drives using the 3d-printing equipment in the UCSF Makers Lab. It has been a busy summer.</p>
<p>Throughout my time here I was able to contribute documentation, workflows, and hardware (my favorite part) to the lab implementation process, and to create software troubleshooting steps that should make it easier for archivists and researchers to use the lab equipment to retrieve difficult-to-read media and file formats from our archival collections.</p>
<p>I also appreciate being able to learn more about archival processing for digital collections in the context of digital forensics and born-digital archival materials. I gained practical field experience with both digital forensic work and digital curation that I can take back with me in the final year of my Master’s degree. Though I’m sad to be leaving the UCSF Library, I am grateful for the experience I’ve gained working on this challenging project, and I hope to return to visit next year.</p>

			<p><em>This is a guest post by Aaron J. Jackson, PhD student, UCSF Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine.</em></p>
<p>One-hundred years ago, the First World War raged into its fourth year. Millions perished in the conflict as the armies of the “civilized” nations applied industrial efficiency to the brutality of warfare. The first weeks of conflict in 1914 shattered traditional conceptions of war. While battlefield success once depended on the ability to field more and better-trained men, the machines of the modern age leveled numerical and soldiery advantages. These new weapons wreaked death and destruction on unprecedented scales and forced the survivors to dig defensive trenchworks that quickly stretched from the Alps to the English Channel along Germany’s Western Front. A deadly stalemate ensued as opposing armies attempted to cross the no man’s land between the trenchworks, often suffering enormous losses in futile assaults. The war became one of attrition and soon caught civilians in its machinations as the richest economies in Europe quickly drained their resources into supplying the war machine.</p>
<p>The entry of the United States into the war in 1917 promised a glimmer of hope for the Allies that they would finally be able to overwhelm the Germans, but it would take time for the enormous resources of the unscathed Americans to be brought to bear. Meanwhile, the Russian collapse in March 1918 presented the German High Command with an opportunity to break the stalemate and deliver a knockout blow before the Americans could fully mobilize by shifting more than fifty divisions of troops from the Russian frontier to the Western Front. The Kaiserschacht, or Spring Offensive, would be the largest German assault of the entire war, with more than three million soldiers poised to break through the Allies’ lines and force a peace on German terms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the men and women of U.S. Army Base Hospital No. 30—the University of California School of Medicine Unit—arrived in France with the expectation of providing expert medical care to the soldiers wounded on the front lines. The hospital unit ostensibly formed before Congress officially declared war on April 6, 1917, and they spent more than a year gathering supplies and personnel, raising funds, navigating the Army bureaucracy, training in the latest medical techniques and military drills, and traveling to France where they expected to set up a hospital and get to “the work” of caring for the wounded. What they found in France, however, was the Herculean task of converting an ancient resort town in the Auvergne Mountains into a modern hospital.</p>
<p>This entry, the third of four planned posts, will cover “the work” of Base Hospital No. 30. After the arrival of the first patient train in June 1918, hospital personnel worked around the clock caring for thousands of sick and wounded soldiers—many of them surgical cases—right through the Armistice of November 11, 1918. These stories are derived primarily from materials kept at the <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections</a> at the Parnassus Library in San Francisco, and it is with great appreciation to the archival staff there that I write about the experiences of the men and women of the University of California School of Medicine in the Great War. If you have not read them yet, please take a moment to read <strong>Part One: Organization, Mobilization, and Travel </strong>and <strong>Part Two: France </strong>for the context they provide.</p>

<p>The German army began the <em>Kaiserschlacht </em>in March 1918 with a massive artillery barrage, dropping more than one million heavy shells on the Allies’ trenches followed closely by lightning-fast stormtrooper assaults to break through opposing lines and create gaps that could be exploited and held by masses of infantry. This strategy allowed the Germans to break the stalemate that had dominated the Western Front since late 1914 and gain ground. They repeated their process in five separate assaults between March and July, gaining enough ground to put Paris under threat.</p>
<p>By June, as the offensive approached the Marne River, American troops including elements of the U.S. Marine Corps rushed to form defensive lines to hold back the Kaiser’s troops at Belleau Wood near Chateau-Thierry. As the Marines dug hasty defensive positions, retreating French troops warned them of the coming Germans and encouraged the Marines to fall back to better ground.</p>
<p>“Retreat? Hell! We just got here!” replied Captain Lloyd W. Williams of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, 5<sup>th</sup> Marines. Fighting from hastily-dug, shallow fighting positions, the Marines took advantage of an 800-yard long wheat field and their training as expert riflemen to halt the German advance and force the Kaiser’s forward elements to dig their own defensive positions in Belleau Wood and the nearby town of Bouresches. Having stalled the Germans, the Americans knew that they had to counterattack before the Germans could dig in too far.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 6, 1918, the Marines charged across the knee-high wheat fields separating them from the entrenched Germans. As they ran, German machineguns opened up, cutting down the charging Americans like the wheat through which they ran. German artillery rained down on the Marines with the high explosive shells shaking the ground and shattering bodies. Despite heavy losses, the Marines managed to reach the edge of the woods and the outskirts of Bouresches before their assault finally stalled, but they paid a heavy price. It was the costliest single day of fighting in the history of the Marine Corps to that date as 228 men gave up their lives and another 859 suffered wounds. And the fighting was far from over.</p>
<p>Over the subsequent twenty days, the Marines fought so fiercely to dislodge the Germans from Belleau Wood that they earned the nickname <em>Teufel Hunden</em> or “Devil Dogs” from their German opponents. The fighting was often hand-to-hand with artillery splintering the trees and filling the air with deadly wooden splinters in addition to shrapnel. Desperate to halt the American advance, the Germans deployed mustard gas, a chemical weapon that painfully blisters the skin, burns the eyes resulting in blindness, and inflames the lungs making breathing impossible if inhaled. As many as 2,000 Marines fell victim to the gas. By June 26, when the Marines finally secured Belleau Wood, they had suffered 1,811 killed and 7,966 wounded.</p>
<div id="attachment_3881" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3881" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-1024x170.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="97" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-1024x170.jpg 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-300x50.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-768x127.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-1536x254.jpg 1536w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-2048x339.jpg 2048w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-13-Evacuating-the-Wounded-500x83.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3881" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13 &#8211; Evacuating the Wounded.</p></div>
<p>The wounded began a journey through a tiered system of medical care established by the Army. The first stage consisted of regimental aid stations located just behind the front lines. Those who were able to do so walked to these stations while stretcher bearers carried the rest. Medical corpsmen and the occasional doctor would dress their wounds, send superficial cases back to the front lines, and coordinate the evacuation of the seriously wounded by motorized ambulance to the clearing stations and field hospitals located further behind the lines.</p>
<p>The field hospitals and clearing stations, while out of range of small arms fire, were often still within range of enemy artillery and aircraft. Despite these hazards, teams of nurses, doctors, and surgeons worked to stabilize their patients, clean their wounds, and prepare them for evacuation to the base hospitals located well out of danger. It was at these facilities that nurses would flush the eyes of gas attack victims with saline solution and surgeons would perform emergency surgeries under extreme conditions, often lacking proper supplies. The wounded who could be stabilized enough for the trip would then be loaded onto hospital trains for the journey to base hospitals like Base Hospital Thirty at Royat, five-hundred kilometers away from the front at Chateau-Thierry.</p>

<p>When the first hospital train arrived at Base Hospital No. 30 on June 12, 1918, the hospital was not yet operational as the main kitchen installation was incomplete. Thankfully, the 360 patients aboard that first train were primarily convalescents who were able to help complete the preparations in time for the second train’s arrival on June 17. This second train held 461 seriously wounded patients from the fighting near Belleau Wood. Captain Earnest H. Falconer, Medical Corps (MC), described the scene for posterity in the pages of <em>The Record</em>:</p>
<p><em>On June 17 a train arrived in two sections, containing many gas cases…. These cases had been gassed on June 14. Many of them had severe skin burns, some comprising as much as one-eighth to one-half the total skin surface. In the more superficial burns the skin was a dusky purplish to reddish purple hue. The deeper burns were pale, translucent, edematous, with many blisters. In most cases serum was drained from blisters. The serum from these blisters was very irritating to the skin of the hands of the dressers, causing in some cases a mild dermatitis to be set up…. Nearly all these cases had burns on the scrotum and penis, which were painful and very slow healing. Also nearly all the cases had burns of the lids and conjunctiva, with occasional burns of the face and scalp. Many cases of bronchopneumonia were already present when the patients were admitted, and a number of these cases developed shortly after admission. These cases were nearly all fatal…. The cases with superficial burns healed for the most part very slowly. New skin formation progressed slowly, and the crusts that formed invariably contained pus beneath them.</em></p>
<p>Base Hospital Thirty consisted of 25 officers (all physicians), 65 nurses, and about 150 enlisted corpsmen. By June 18, they were treating 821 wounded soldiers, many requiring extra attention due to the nature of their injuries. The staff worked continually performing surgery, cleaning wounds, and feeding the patients, all the while continuing their efforts to improve the hospital’s infrastructure. Thankfully, the surgical cases in the first two trains were less taxing because their wounds had been debrided of foreign objects and dead and damaged tissue at the clearing stations and field hospitals. Amputations were dressed but kept open, allowing hospital staff to manage the healing process and maintain an aseptic wound environment. This was achieved through the Carrel-Dakin method, which involved applying diluted chlorine and bleach solution to wounds and dressings to prevent infections. It must have been an excruciating experience for the patients, but it worked to prevent deadly infections in the era before antibiotics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all patients arrived in similarly good conditions. A train on August 21 contained men who had been kept in the clearing stations as medical professionals attempted to stabilize them enough for travel. They arrived with infected wounds requiring extensive debridement, additional surgery, and the occasional re-amputation of a limb to establish aseptic wound environments.</p>
<p>After the arrival of the first trains in June, hospital staff worked around the clock for months on end. Patient trains would arrive, usually and preferably with some notice, and the wounded would be carried by stretcher into the hospital and sorted. Surgical teams worked continuously, often without the aid of the x-ray machines for a want of electric power. The laboratory was similarly handicapped, making diagnosis and treatment that much harder for physicians. Nurses worked tirelessly to clean wounds, dole out medications, fill out charts, and keep a clean and ventilated environment. Corpsmen carried patients up several flights of stairs to their rooms, hauled water in buckets for want of proper plumbing, cooked meals in the kitchens and delivered them to non-ambulatory patients’ rooms, removed waste from the rooms, made new batches of Carrel-Dakin solution, worked to improve the plumbing and heating in the old hotels, loaded and unloaded hospital and supply trains, and somehow found a way to help keep the streets of Royat clean and the hotel cesspools from overflowing. There was so much work that ambulatory patients were conscripted to assist. And just when the hospital appeared to find its rhythm, events found a way to throw it off.</p>
<div id="attachment_3883" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3883" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-1024x355.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="202" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-1024x355.jpg 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-300x104.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-768x266.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-1536x533.jpg 1536w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic-500x173.jpg 500w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-15-Flu-Pandemic.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3883" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 15 &#8211; The Influenza Pandemic of 1918.</p></div>
<p>On September 22, 1918, when the hospital was near full capacity, a train full of French patients arrived in the middle of the night without prior notice. Due to the hour, the hospital staff decided that the best course of action was to distribute the new patients throughout the hospital wherever a spare bed could be found. Unfortunately, they discovered that practically all the new patients were suffering from acute respiratory infection. Distributing them through the hospital into crowded rooms exposed other patients as well as the staff to infection.</p>
<p>By the end of September, as many as 40 of the 150 enlisted men assigned to Base Hospital No. 30 had to be hospitalized themselves, and many officers and nurses were also afflicted to a milder degree. Five corpsmen and one officer died from their infections, and as the epidemic spread among neighboring units, the hospital’s local admissions amounted to between 30 and 70 new patients a day. Making matters more difficult, the hospital’s laboratory officer and his assistants fell ill, necessitating a suspension of investigative work on the mysterious disease. Autopsies of the first victims indicated the cause of death to be pneumonia developed as a complication following a likely infection of influenza. The hospital staff could do little to combat the contagious disease other than to reorganize the patients to attempt to hinder its spread.</p>
<p>While Base Hospital Thirty dealt with its share of the Influenza Pandemic of 1918, they received orders to expand the hospital to accommodate anticipated casualties from the ongoing Allied counteroffensive. The Germans’ <em>kaiserschlacht</em> floundered in July and the Allies, their numbers and supplies flush with fresh American troops and materiel, had been pushing the Germans back ever since. Base Hospital No. 30 officers examined potential sites for expansion in Royat and completed leases for new buildings in September. They established another surgical unit and moved their administrative offices into the Royat Palace Hotel on September 26. The new buildings allowed them to finally abandon the old “dungeon” kitchen in the Continental hotel and create a new kitchen in the Grand Hotel, which did not have the Continental’s cesspool problems. The new space also allowed for the creation of a dedicated ward for respiratory and enteric cases, freeing up space in the already-established portions of the hospital for surgical and bed-ridden patients.</p>
<div id="attachment_3884" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3884" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-1024x390.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="222" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-1024x390.jpg 1024w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-300x114.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-768x292.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-1536x584.jpg 1536w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital-500x190.jpg 500w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-16-Expanding-the-Hospital.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3884" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 16 – Patient wards at Base Hospital No. 30 in Royat, France, 1918-1919.</p></div>
<p>The hospital also expanded beyond adding new wards. Corpsmen built warehouses near the rail head to ease the burdens of transferring supplies and coal bunkers to provide a consistent fuel supply for heating the hospital as the days and nights grew colder. The Army assigned more corpsmen to the hospital staff, and the officers organized a small local labor force to help keep up with waste, garbage, and maintenance concerns. Perhaps the most welcome addition to the hospital’s roster was a section of Army engineers to finally improve the hospital’s water, sewer, and electrical supplies. Corpsmen would no longer have to haul buckets of water up stairs or worry about overflowing cesspools, allowing them to do the work for which they trained, and there was plenty of that to go around. By the end of September 1918, Base Hospital No. 30 had roughly 30 physicians, 60 nurses, and 250 corpsmen to take care of a 2,400-bed facility, and the combination of the war and pandemic ensured that the hospital continued to operate near capacity. Beyond the work in Royat, the UC Medical School unit also contributed surgical teams to support the effort of stabilizing the wounded near the front lines. Two such teams, each consisting of two surgeons, two nurses, and three corpsmen, set out for the front lines to work in field hospitals to provide surgical intervention to wounded men, often within only a few hours of their injuries.</p>

<p>Surgical Team No. 50 was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alanson Weeks, who once played fullback for the undefeated 1898 Michigan Wolverines before moving to San Francisco to become a surgeon. Alongside Captain John Homer Woolsey, Nurses Agnes Dunn and Alta Ireland, and three enlisted men, Weeks set out for the front lines on June 6, 1918. The team arrived at the American Red Cross Hospital at Juilly (today on the northeast outskirts of Paris) at 3 p.m. on the 7<sup>th</sup> and his team was immediately assigned to an operating room and remained in surgery until 8 o’clock the following morning.  Dr. Weeks recalled the experiences of the team’s time at Juilly in <em>The Record</em>:</p>
<p><em>The wounds were very severe in type, many fractures and a high percentage were infected with “gas” bacilli. There were also 300 “gassed” cases who were first treated at this hospital. The sight of these gassed men, lying on stretchers and filling the entire courtyard—blinded, hacking, begging for water, for protection from the sunlight for their sensitive eyes, and for something to relieve their pain—gave all of us a craving desire to meet the Hun and kill. June 16 saw the end of this tremendous rush of wounded…. The Team operated for the most part at night and during its watch cared for all neurological cases and approximately a total of 240 wounded.</em></p>
<p>Surgical Team Fifty specialized in neurological cases, of which there were many. Due to the nature of trench warfare, headwounds were frighteningly common as the soldier’s head was usually the only part of his body exposed to enemy fire. But like all surgical teams, No. 50 dealt with all types of cases as they came in, often without much notice. Victims of gunshots, artillery shrapnel, high explosive shock, chemical weapons, and even bayonet wounds were common sights, and the work kept coming. The seventeen-hour shift the team worked on its first day at Juilly would become routine until the team returned to Base Hospital Thirty in late October.</p>
<p>Before Surgical Team No. 50 could return, Base Hospital No. 30 sent out another surgical team, No. 51, under the command of Major Herbert S. Thomson on September 10 to support the evacuation hospital at Toul, near Nancy to support the St. Mihiel offensive. Accompanying Dr. Thomson was Captain Homer C. Seaver, who had graduated from the University of California Medical School only weeks before deploying to France, along with nurses Adelaide Brown and Kathleen Fores and three corpsmen.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving at Toul, Surgical Team Fifty-One was put to work and faced similar working conditions to their predecessors, working seventeen out of the first twenty-four hours. They only saw the most serious cases and had no opportunity to follow up on their patients. As soon as they finished working to stabilize one patient, orderlies would take him off the table and another patient would take his place. The pace of work and long days coincided with the military offensives as the team worked sixteen- or seventeen-hour shifts for a week during the St. Mihiel offensive. During the space between assaults, the teams often found themselves traveling to a new front to support a new offensive.</p>
<p>Imagine graduating medical school and within a matter of weeks finding yourself working 16-hour days, seven days a week, doing nothing but intensive surgery on the most severe trauma cases imaginable and not being able to follow up on the results of your work because there are so many patients waiting—and literally dying in the process—for you to save their life. Such was the medical residency of Dr. Homer C. Seaver.</p>
<div id="attachment_3886" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3886" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-18-Argonne-Offensive-1024x600.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="342" /><p id="caption-attachment-3886" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18 &#8211; The Meuse-Argonne Offensive, September 26 &#8211; November 11, 1918.</p></div>
<p>In October, Surgical Team No. 51 received orders to support the offensive into the Argonne Forest. The fighting there resembled Belleau Wood. The Germans had been beating a slow retreat since June, but now that their homeland was imperiled for the first time of the war, they turned and fought hard. In his account of the event for <em>The Record</em>, Major Thomson described the work in the Argonne:</p>
<p><em>We were ordered from Toul to the Argonne Forest on October 8 and received transportation by ambulances to Evacuation Hospital No. 14, situated in the Argonne Forest near the village of Les Islettes. This hospital was situated in the heart of the Argonne Forest near the line of American advance and in a country that had been completely destroyed by the Germans in their former campaign. The hospital was entirely under canvas except for a small chateau which housed the nurses and senior officers. This country was very wet; it rained nearly every day and there was mud everywhere. The operating tent was pitched on the ground and for the first few days there was considerable mud on the operating room floor. In order to go from the operating room to the wards, one had to wade through about six or eight inches of mud. While at Les Islettes, the Team was busy all the time, working on the twelve-hour shift. There never was a time when anyone had a breathing spell as the triage was always filled with patients and there was frequently a line of ambulances waiting in the road. At this hospital, only the seriously wounded were treated and there was a very large number of gas infections. Many times, patients were brought in from two or three days after being wounded and a patient was rarely operated on within 15 hours of being wounded. At this hospital, we were near the German lines and were treated to the spectacle of anti-aircraft guns shooting at the German planes and could always see the observation balloons over the forest to the north. It was difficult to get supplies in this region and the hospital was rather poorly equipped. On the 25<sup>th</sup> of October the Team was ordered to return to Base Hospital Thirty.</em></p>
<p>Thus, the work of Base Hospital No. 30 continued throughout the long months from June to November 1918. Their commemorative book <em>The Record</em> demonstrates just how busy “the work of the hospital” really was by its absences more than its inclusions. The pages of <em>The Record</em> are filled with pictures from the hospital unit’s early days of organization, its travels to France, and its struggles to transform a resort town into a modern hospital. But it only includes a few pictures of “the work.” Perhaps this absence is due to the fact that everyone was too busy caring for their charges to be able to take pictures or jot down notes for posterity. Or perhaps the absence marks a time in the history of Base Hospital No. 30 that needed no commemoration in something like <em>The Record</em> because those who were there remember it well. Perhaps both possibilities are true.</p>
<div id="attachment_3887" style="width: 766px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3887" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-19-Armistice.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="254" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-19-Armistice.jpg 756w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-19-Armistice-300x101.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-19-Armistice-500x168.jpg 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3887" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 19 &#8211; Armistice Declared, November 11, 1918.</p></div>
<p>Regardless, when the Armistice went into effect on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and while the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the fighting, “the work of the hospital” at Base Hospital No. 30 and other hospitals throughout Europe and the United States continued at a frantic pace. For weeks, wounded men would continue to pour in to Royat.</p>
<p>This concludes Part Three: The Work of the Hospital. One part yet remains in the tale of the remarkable men and women of Base Hospital Thirty. In the final part of this series, we will take a closer look at some of the remarkable people who carried out that work, how they came home again, and what happened to them after the war.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to take the opportunity to encourage you to take a moment and visit the collection at the University of California San Francisco’s Parnassus Library in the Archives and Special Collections to read more about the incredible men and women who made up the University of California Medical School Unit in the First World War.</p>

<p>Included in the Greenspan papers are files related to the Women&#8217;s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). WIHS was organized in 1993 to investigate the impact of HIV infection on women. It is one of the largest and longest ongoing U.S. studies of its kind, with clinical sites and cohorts throughout the country. John Greenspan and Deborah Greenspan, his wife and longtime research partner, participated in research activities associated with WIHS.</p>
<p>In the collection are copies of WIHS newsletters created for and by women living with HIV. The newsletters include updates on WIHS research, stories and letters from participating women, event announcements, and other related information. Below are sample pages from the Spring 1997 issue of <em>Health WIHS,</em> a publication of the Women&#8217;s lnteragency HIV Study in Chicago.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3869" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-789x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="758" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-789x1024.jpg 789w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-231x300.jpg 231w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-768x997.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-1183x1536.jpg 1183w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1-1577x2048.jpg 1577w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs1.jpg 1782w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3870" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs3-789x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="758" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs3-789x1024.jpg 789w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs3-231x300.jpg 231w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs3-768x997.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs3.jpg 891w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3871" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs4.jpg" alt="" width="624" height="810" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs4.jpg 624w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mss201614_33_1_wihs4-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></p>

			<p><em>This is a guest post by Lauren Wolters, UCSF Archives Intern.</em></p>
<p>I have recently completed my internship working in the UCSF Archives and Special Collections. I really enjoyed the challenge of a new experience and learned a tremendous amount in my short time working there.</p>
<div id="attachment_3853" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3853" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/default-1024x702.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-3853" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://calisphere.org/item/5df605c8-9dc5-4584-a117-d22983577e83/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Langley Porter Clinic, circa 1945. Photograph Collection, UCSF Archives.</a></p></div>
<p>During my internship I was able to complete several processing and arrangement projects. I created two finding aids, one for the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute records and another for the files of Bernice Hemphill, longtime head of the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank.</p>
<div id="attachment_3854" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3854" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MSS2011_23_slides_SOP_1966img013-1024x703.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="401" /><p id="caption-attachment-3854" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://calisphere.org/item/df918953-968b-4c92-998c-73594e87a87c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irwin Memorial Blood Bank display at UCSF School of Pharmacy, April 1966. Robert Day Collection.</a></p></div>
<p>I appreciated the opportunity to learn from an archival mentor and gain practical experience by independently processing each collection and working with tangible materials. It was very satisfying being able to contribute to the preservation of these documents and their history and help make them more accessible for future use. I look forward to being able to pursue future endeavors with an informed understanding of the archival process.</p>

			<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri;font-size: medium">Edith Martinez, our former intern who has been assisting with the NHPRC project to process the AIDS History Project newly acquired collections, has joined the archives team as a part-time Project Archivist for the <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/tobacco/">Tobacco Control Archives</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri;font-size: medium">The Tobacco Control Archives (TCA) was established in 1994 with the initial support from the University of California Tobacco Related Disease Research Program (TRDRP), the Centers for Disease Control, and private funding.  The TCA serves as a major resource for public policy research. The Project Archivist is responsible for processing the TCA collections stored onsite and offsite. Over the past twenty years, the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections has amassed an extensive collection of organizational records of government agencies and activist groups, as well as papers of individuals active in tobacco control. Currently TCA contains almost 100 collection titles, however only 40 of them are cataloged and even fewer are fully processed. The Project Archivist will arrange and describe the remaining unprocessed material, create or update finding aids, upload them to the Online Archive of California, create catalog records, and update the TCA section on the archives website.</span></p>

			<p><em>Post by Sabrina Oliveros, Guest Curator for Open Wide: 500 Years of Dentistry in Art.</em></p>
<p>What do a famous French dentist, Snow White, and a Victorian gentleman with a pesky toothache have in common? They are a few of the harassed, horrified, and often hilarious figures you can find in <em>Open Wide: 500 Years of Dentistry in Art, </em>UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections’ new exhibit that will open to the public on August 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Developed around selections from the collection of Dr. Morton G. Rivo, D.D.S., former Chief of Periodontics at the UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion, <em>Open Wide</em> offers a glimpse into how perspectives on dentistry – and dentistry itself – have changed over the centuries. The artworks, supplemented by artifacts, rare books, and other materials from the UCSF Archives, will be on display on three floors of the UCSF Library.</p>
<p>You can find the artworks featuring the French dentist in the main lobby, Snow White on the first floor, and the Victorian gentleman on the fifth. Each speaks to a theme in <em>Open Wide</em>: developments in dental practices; symbolism and beliefs that have grown around the teeth; and, perhaps not the least, that all-too-familiar feeling of <em>not</em> wanting to go to the dentist.</p>
<p><strong>The French Dentist</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3846" style="width: 563px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3846" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-French-Dentist-copy-copy.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="380" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-French-Dentist-copy-copy.jpg 553w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-French-Dentist-copy-copy-300x206.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-French-Dentist-copy-copy-437x300.jpg 437w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3846" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The French Dentist Shewing a Specimen of His Artificial Teeth and False Palates</em> (1811) by Thomas Rowlandson.</p></div>
<p>If you’ve explored the UCSF Library or its social media recently, you might have already spotted the French dentist and his grinning patient in the exhibition poster, which is based on an 1811 etching, <em>The French Dentist Shewing a Specimen of His Artificial Teeth and False Palates. </em>The dentist of the title is Nicholas Dubois de Chémant, who was credited with the patents for the first porcelain teeth in Paris and London. The print pokes fun at a moment in history when these were all the rage among the upper classes, having been considered better than earlier ones of ivory and bone.</p>
<p><em>The French Dentist</em> and his patient may seem very pleased with themselves, but the technology behind dentures still had to be perfected in the decades to come. You’ll find other samples of false teeth, developed through the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, exhibited alongside this print.</p>
<p><strong>The Toothache</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3847" style="width: 434px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3847" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Toothache_13_smallsize.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="499" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Toothache_13_smallsize.jpg 424w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Toothache_13_smallsize-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3847" class="wp-caption-text">An illustration from <em>The Toothache</em> (c. 1849) written by Horace Mayhew and illustrated by George Cruikshank.</p></div>
<p>Who would do <em>anything</em> not to go to the dentist? One Victorian gentleman, the protagonist of a comic strip published around 1849, certainly does. He even attempts to cauterize his own tooth with a red-hot poker and tries “240 infallible cures”– which include filling his mouth with cold water and sitting on the fireplace hob to let it boil – just to avoid a visit.</p>
<p>Discover whether his attempts at self-treatment amount to anything through panels that have been reproduced from the original illustrations. This Victorian gentleman’s adventures are complemented by similarly humorous cartoons from UCSF School of Dentistry yearbooks published in the 1900s.</p>
<p><strong>Out Hunting for Teeth</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3848" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3848" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-Chagoya-copy.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="533" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-Chagoya-copy.jpg 361w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Wide-Chagoya-copy-203x300.jpg 203w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3848" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A caza de dientes</em> (Out Hunting for Teeth) from the series <em>Return to Goya’s Caprichos</em> (1999) by Enrique Chagoya.</p></div>
<p>Amidst all the amusing images in <em>Open Wide, </em>several prints strike a graver tone. These include three etchings depicting an 18<sup>th</sup>-century practice: pulling a hanged man’s teeth to use them for love potions. The earliest etching, by the Spanish master Francisco Goya, critiques this superstition; the second, by Salvador Dalí, mimics Goya’s and echoes some of Dalí’s sexual beliefs about teeth.</p>
<p>Snow White appears in the latest iteration of the scene, a commentary on Eurocentrism in art made by the Mexican-born American artist Enrique Chagoya. Here the Disney princess has replaced the young girl taking the corpse’s teeth in the original print, while another cartoon character, Rat Fink, has replaced the dead man. Superstitions about the teeth may no longer be the focal point of the piece, but it still has bite.</p>
<p>Goya and Dalí are not the only international luminaries represented in the show; <em>Open Wide </em>also features pieces by Marc Chagall, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, and Joan Miró. Aside from Chagoya, the exhibit also showcases other artists with connections to the San Francisco Bay Area, like Matt Phillips, Jeff Leedy, Art Hazelwood, and Dorothy Winslade.</p>
<p><em>Open Wide: 500 Years of Dentistry in Art </em>will be on view until the summer of 2019.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Introduction by Polina Ilieva</strong></em></p>
<p><em>During the spring semester 2018 the archives team co-taught and facilitated a new History of Health Sciences course, the Anatomy of an Archive. The idea of this course was conceived by the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine (DAHSM) Assistant Professor, <a href="http://dahsm.ucsf.edu/faculty/aimee-medeiros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimee Medeiros</a> and UCSF Head of Archives &amp; Special Collections, Polina Ilieva. Kelsi Evans, Project Archivist, co-facilitated the discussion sessions and Kelsi, Polina and David Uhlich, Access and Collections Archivist, served as mentors for students’ processing projects throughout the duration of the course.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this course was to provide an overview of archival science with an emphasis on the theory, methodology, technologies and best practices of archival research, arrangement and description. The archivists put together a list of collections requiring processing and also corresponding to <a href="http://dahsm.ucsf.edu/dahsm_students/historyofhealthscience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">students’ research interests</a> and each student selected one that she/he worked on with her/his mentor to arrange and create a finding aid. During this 10 week long assignment students developed competence researching and describing an archival collection, as well as interpreting the historical record. At the conclusion of this course students wrote a story about their experience and collections they researched for the archives blog. In the next three weeks we will be sharing these posts with you.</em></p>
<p><em>Our final story comes from Hsinyi Hsieh, PhD student, UCSF Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine.</em></p>

<p>Building an archival collection is similar to traveling through space and time. Before embarking on this journey, archival practitioners need to possess a diverse set of creative and sensitive abilities—specifically, a knowledge of scientific principles, a familiarity with artful practices, and the ability to think critically. Most significantly, processing a collection requires getting your hands dirty, interacting with various types of historical materials, and building a rapport with future researchers. I am grateful to have worked with Kelsi Evans and Polina Ilieva, archivists at UCSF, who not only taught me the craft of archival work through the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b2126789~S0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Olney collection</a> but also provided me with a golden opportunity to travel with Dr. Olney.

<p>My archival journey began by imbibing tacit knowledge about processing archival collections. When we encountered some mold affected materials in the Mary Olney collection, the UCSF archivists taught me how to assess a mold bloom. It was truly a fascinating experience to watch as Kelsi and Polina observed the color and smell of the document and defined whether the mold actively presented a hazard to the unaffected materials. This document was sent for professional treatment at the UC Berkeley Library’s Conservation Treatment Division. This is an example of the tacit knowledge possessed by archivists, which only develops through continuous professional practice and education. The mold situation in the archive is akin to unforeseen circumstances arising during a trip. Thanks to the archivists’ expertise, we successfully prevented the other materials from being affected by the mold and kept our archival journey going.</p>

<p>The adventure had the perfect mixture of historical lessons and archival practice. I had the opportunity to learn about Dr. Olney’s experiences as a female pediatrician, social advocate, and director of the Diabetic Youth Foundation (DYF) and its summer camps for diabetic children. As I learned more about the collection, I was able to arrange its photos, pamphlets, and correspondences for future researchers interested not only in Dr. Olney but also pediatric diabetic patients.. Through this immersive experience, I felt as though I had become a part of her camping staff but in the future. In fact, during the archival arrangement, we also reconstructed the progress of Dr. Olney’s efforts in running the summer camps for decades—notably, her hard work in terms of fundraising, staff training, and building relationships with other relevant organizations. Mary Olney was a pioneering pediatrician who not only operated under the broad vision of improving the lives of diabetic children but also employed a practical outlook, doing everything she could to maintain the summer camp for decades.</p>

Olney papers, MSS 98-64.</p></div>
<p>During archival processing, revealing the mystery of certain folders is much like exploring exotic locations while traveling. For example, I was preoccupied with examining several folders in Dr. Olney’s collection that were labeled “loose papers.” Upon examining the documents inside these folders, I found that most of the materials—specifically <em>Bear Facts</em> and <em>Whitaker Whiz</em>—were from the DYF newsletters, which aimed at improving health communication among young diabetic patients. The DYF newsletter was published since the early 1940s and targeted young patients; the newsletter introduced camping programs, provided health information about diabetes, and featured beautiful artwork and written compositions by these patients.</p>
<p>By relabeling these materials, “loose papers,” the archivists were able to provide researchers with more accurate finding aids and inspiration as well. Imagine that you are visiting a new country and are consulting a number of travel guides; the ones that are written more clearly might contain better suggestions on places to explore; these recommendations might be missed if you followed the relatively unclear guidebooks. Further, information that is more accurate can enable researchers to ask questions that might never occur to them otherwise. Take the DYF newsletters, for example. How do the articles in <em>Bear Facts</em> and <em>Whitaker Whiz</em> communicate medical knowledge about diet to young patients and their families? Thus, clarifying vague folder names might improve the experience of users and researchers when exploring such archives, thereby enabling them to contemplate new historical questions.</p>

<p>The task of processing the archival collection took me on a journey to Northern California with Dr. Olney and the DYF foundation during the twentieth century. It took me back to when and where the materials originated and how they would go on to influence researchers in the future. During her lifetime, Dr. Olney continued with her efforts to translate her expertise and knowledge into useful information for young diabetic patients. It takes the invisible labor of archivists to make these accomplishments visible and highlight all aspects of her persona: a female pediatrician, a camp organizer, a Northern California resident, a daughter, and a woman. This has been possible only through processing this archival collection. Thus, the work of archival practitioners plays a crucial role in enabling future researchers to embark on a journey with Dr. Mary Olney. Let me tell you, it is a fun and interesting ride!</p>

			<p>Today’s post is an introduction from Marissa Nadeau, our newest intern here in the Archives. She will be working on the upcoming exhibit, <em>Open Wide: 500 Years of Dentistry in Art.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3826" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NadeauM.jpg" alt="" width="1016" height="884" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NadeauM.jpg 1016w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NadeauM-300x261.jpg 300w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NadeauM-768x668.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NadeauM-345x300.jpg 345w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1016px) 100vw, 1016px" /></em></p>
<p>Marissa Nadeau is from the town of Brookfield, Connecticut, and has lived along the East Coast her entire life. Transferring from a university down in South Carolina to one in Connecticut, Marissa ended up receiving her Bachelor of Arts from New York University, majoring in Art History with a double minor in Italian and Creative Writing (2016). During her time in NYC, Marissa interned in galleries and non-profits throughout the Chelsea neighborhood, most notably C24 Gallery and The Kitchen; she helped expand their social media platforms and fell in love with curatorial work by getting the chance to work closely with the team’s curator and contemporary artists. Marissa had the opportunity to study in Florence, Italy, for a semester (2015), which allowed her to adopt a global perspective of museums and the art market.</p>
<p>Marissa uprooted her East Coast ties and moved to San Francisco to follow her passion of pursuing curatorial work, and is currently a Masters candidate in the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/museum-studies/program-details">University of San Francisco’s Museum Studies program</a>. She co-curated <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/thacher-gallery/modern-myth"><em>Modern Myth: South Asian Modern and Contemporary Works on Paper</em></a> at the school’s Thacher Gallery in 2017, and has been interning with the Bay Area’s <a href="https://www.for-site.org/">FOR-SITE Foundation</a> since January 2018.</p>
<p>Marissa is excited for her newest role as a Curatorial Intern at the UCSF Archives &amp; Special Collections and she looks forward to gaining a better understanding of archival best practices, while putting her theoretical knowledge to the test. She will be assisting with research, design, and installation of the upcoming exhibit, <em>Open Wide: 500 Years of Dentistry in Art</em>, opening this summer in the Library.</p>

			<p><em><strong>Introduction by Polina Ilieva</strong></em></p>
<p><em>During the spring semester 2018 the archives team co-taught and facilitated a new History of Health Sciences course, the Anatomy of an Archive. The idea of this course was conceived by the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine (DAHSM) Assistant Professor, <a href="http://dahsm.ucsf.edu/faculty/aimee-medeiros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimee Medeiros</a> and UCSF Head of Archives &amp; Special Collections, Polina Ilieva. Kelsi Evans, Project Archivist, co-facilitated the discussion sessions and Kelsi, Polina and David Uhlich, Access and Collections Archivist, served as mentors for students’ processing projects throughout the duration of the course.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this course was to provide an overview of archival science with an emphasis on the theory, methodology, technologies and best practices of archival research, arrangement and description. The archivists put together a list of collections requiring processing and also corresponding to <a href="http://dahsm.ucsf.edu/dahsm_students/historyofhealthscience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">students’ research interests</a> and each student selected one that she/he worked on with her/his mentor to arrange and create a finding aid. During this 10 week long assignment students developed competence researching and describing an archival collection, as well as interpreting the historical record. At the conclusion of this course students wrote a story about their experience and collections they researched for the archives blog. In the next three weeks we will be sharing these posts with you.</em></p>
<p><em>This week’s story comes from Antoine S. Johnson, PhD student, UCSF Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine.</em></p>
<p><strong>Post by Antoine S. Johnson</strong></p>
<p>Historically, racism in America has taken its toll on its victims and UCSF has been no exception—from the black hospital sanitary worker who was restricted to use only the basement bathroom to the qualified medical student denied residency. One month after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., black employees fought back and formed the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1273804~S0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Caucus</a>. The organization not only fought for equal treatment but also advocated for the reaffirmation of black humanity and an increased awareness about the health impact of racism on its sufferers.</p>
<p>The Black Power Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s consisted of witty slogans that reasserted black humanity. African Americans shouted slogans such as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/video/black-is-beautiful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Black is Beautiful&#8221;</a> as a way to convince themselves that black was not as negative and distasteful as society portrayed it. This had important psychological effects. The Black Caucus ensured black staff, faculty, and students joined the movement with similar quotes and passages in its <em>Black Bulletin</em>. In fact, in a March 1971 edition of the <em>Bulletin</em>, the Caucus adopted its own version of the catchphrase, “Black Beauty You Are the Best.” Promoting blackness in a positive way was a unique way for the Caucus to align itself with larger black issues. To show their solidarity, the Caucus advertised speaking engagements and updates on leaders of the Black Power Movement, including Huey P. Newton, Angela Davis, and Kathleen Cleaver.</p>
<p>The Black Caucus aimed to demonstrate that racism not only is an injustice but that it can be hazardous to one’s health. Racial discrimination was stressful, it argued. Also, in a 1972 letter to the chancellor, the Caucus posited, “One theory of psychology revolves around the fact that crises and confrontation are two of the most volatile means of bringing about change.”</p>

<p>Thus, they refused to allow emotional issues to fall by the wayside, even if the university saw such problems as trivial. The stress could also be a trigger for underlying issues, like <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G6PD Deficiency.</a> In G6PD, stress is one of the main triggers, resulting in abdominal and back pain, as well as fever and fatigue. The genetic disorder destroys red blood cells prematurely, cutting off oxygen traveling to the lungs, shortening one’s breath, and increasing their heart rate. In the United States, the condition is most common among men of African descent. Aware of this correlation, in 1971, the Caucus screened nearly 600 people on campus for sickle-cell anemia research and G6PD. This campaign to make visible the damage stress brought on by racism could do to black people was extended to the community via the Blackman’s Free Clinic on McAllister Street. Racism knows no boundaries, and the Black Caucus wanted to bring awareness to what should be considered a health concern beyond the walls of UCSF.</p>
<p>The health of African Americans, in particular mental health, also influenced the Caucus’ demands to diversify UCSF’s clinical faculty. In a statistical document from 1972, the Black Caucus concluded that one in 670 white American citizens became doctors, compared to one in every 5,000 African Americans. The psychiatry department was one of the main divisions in which the Caucus, as well as Edward Weinshel, then-director of the Department of Psychiatry, saw as an imperative to the school’s future. In fact, in a letter dated July 14, 1971, Weinshel pleaded for the university’s psychiatry department to recruit more black applicants. Dr. Charles T. Carman, the Acting Dean, responded in less than two weeks, notifying Weinshel that he sent his letter to the chairman of the psychiatry department, the Assistant Dean for Postdoctoral Affairs, and to Joanne Lewis, then the chairperson of the Black Caucus.</p>
<div id="attachment_3815" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3815" src="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-788x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="759" srcset="https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-788x1024.jpg 788w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-231x300.jpg 231w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-768x998.jpg 768w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-1182x1536.jpg 1182w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1-1575x2048.jpg 1575w, https://broughttolight.ucsf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mss8538_1_15d_weinshel1.jpg 1697w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3815" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://calisphere.org/item/ff6e9c3c-655a-4722-a871-526cc7c03e4c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letter (page one of two) from Dr. Weinshel clamoring for the recruitment of African Americans in psychiatry, Black Caucus Records, MSS 85-38, Archives and Special Collections, UCSF Library.</a></p></div>
<p>A vested interest in black students would result in more licensed black psychiatrists, a field that both the Caucus and Weinshel saw in dire need of black physicians to assess the mental and physical characteristics of black patients. More importantly, Weinshel foresaw black psychiatrists assisting members of the Westside Community Mental Health Consortium, home of the “greatest number of black residents in San Francisco as well as significant numbers of other minority groups.”</p>
<p>Indeed, “A mind is a terrible thing to waste;” it is also a terrible thing not to protect. UCSF’s Black Caucus was keenly aware of the potential harm endemic racism had on black faculty, staff, and students and surrounding community members. By promoting racial pride and bringing attention to the harmful effects of racism, the Black Caucus spearheaded a movement that highlighted the mental implications of racism, offered solutions, and found allies in their struggle who saw avenues through which the Caucus could get involved within and outside of the university.</p>
