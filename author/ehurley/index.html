<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services &amp; Accesioning Archivist</p>



<p>June 5, 1981 is widely known as the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States because it was the day that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) published, in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the appearance of a cluster of diseases that would later come to be known as AIDS (Acquired Immune Difficiency Syndrome). The report, titled “<em>Pneumocystis</em>&nbsp;Pneumonia &#8212; Los Angeles,” was authored by five UCLA doctors: MS Gottlieb, MD, HM Schanker, MD, PT Fan, MD, A Saxon, MD, JD Weisman, DO, of the Division of Clinical Immunology-Allergy at the UCLA Medical Center. The article reports, “In the period October 1980-May 1981, 5 young men, all active homosexuals, were treated for biopsy-confirmed&nbsp;<em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>&nbsp;pneumonia at 3 different hospitals in Los Angeles, California.”<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> The primary author of this report, Doctor Michael S. Gottlieb &#8211; then 33 years old &#8211; made history as the person who discovered AIDS.&nbsp; UCSF Archives and Special Collections is pleased to house Dr. Gottlieb’s archives, which are now processed and available for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="538" height="800" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-18-at-4.01.42-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4797" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-18-at-4.01.42-PM.png 538w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-18-at-4.01.42-PM-202x300.png 202w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><figcaption>Photo of Dr. Michael Gottlieb by Elizabeth Nathane, originally published in the <em>Los Angeles Blade</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A record of his professional life and accomplishments, as well as the many honors and awards he received over the course of his career, the Michael S. Gottlieb papers contain published papers by Gottlieb and many others on AIDS-related topics. They also include information on various AIDS drug treatment studies (including AZT), professional and personal correspondence, and information about various talks and events attended by Gottlieb during the 1980s – a busy decade for him. They also document his prodigious philanthropic activities and AIDS advocacy. </p>



<p>Gottlieb figures prominently in this <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/06/420686/40-years-aids-timeline-epidemic">UCSF-generated timeline of the AIDS epidemic</a>. The timeline, which begins with the 1981 MMWR report, notes that, in 1985, Rock Hudson – star of classic Hollywood films like <em>Giant</em>, <em>All That Heaven Allows, </em>and <em>Written on the Wind</em> – announced that he had AIDS and later died, becoming “the first major celebrity to succumb to the disease.”<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> Later that same year, the timeline reports, “The American Foundation for AIDS Research is founded with the help of movie star Elizabeth Taylor.” Gottlieb, who served as Rock Hudson’s physician from the time of his AIDS diagnosis to his death from the disease, was also one of the founding chairs of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, along with medical researcher Mathilde Krim and Taylor, who was a close friend of Hudson’s and his costar in <em>Giant.</em> The Foundation was established with a $250,000 gift from Hudson’s estate.  The Gottlieb papers also contain a fascinating trove of letters, which he dubbed “Crazy letters,” that he received after becoming publicly associated with Hudson in newspapers and the press. The letters indicate a fascination with the disease, which was still very new and widely misunderstood by the world at large.</p>

Gottlieb papers, you can consult the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c86d618s/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c86d618s/">finding aid </a>or the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b2913503~S0" data-type="URL" data-id="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b2913503~S0">library catalog record</a> for the collection. The papers were a gift from Michael Gottlieb.</p>

<p>Brought to Light wants to bring attention to remarkable former UCSF faculty member Freeman Bradley. His significant contributions to the medical community and the Black community at UCSF deserve to be recognized. Bradley grew up in Alabama, and after high school, he continued his education at Howard University in Washington D.C., where he received his bachelor&#8217;s degree in Biology. After his graduation, Bradley moved to Maryland and started working at the National Institute of Health, where he remained for four years before starting his career at UCSF. His position was with the Cardiovascular Research Institute, where he conducted research about respiratory changes associated with various anesthesias.</p>



<p>During his time at UCSF, Freeman Bradley worked as a technician to Dr. John Severinghaus and and Bradley’s contributions were fundamental to Severinghaus’s groundbreaking work. From 1957 to 1958, Dr. Severinghaus and Mr. Bradley combined technology created by Richard Stow and Leland Clark to create the first blood gas analysis system. Shortly after the first system was created, they were commercialized and proved revolutionary in health care. In Dr. Severinghaus&#8217;s written account of his research and the evolution of the invention of the blood gas analysis system, he emphasizes how his and Mr. Bradley&#8217;s invention changed medicine. By the 1960s they blood gas analysis systems were widely available, and and these tests provided essential information about a patient’s illness.. These systems are still used today, and in 1985 Dr. Severinghaus donated the first apparatus he and Mr. Bradley worked on at the Smithsonian Museum. In 1977 after his research with Dr. Severinghaus, Mr. Bradley was appointed Director of Development and Research. In this position, he helped progress the technology and development of medical tools. One of the other advancements he made at his time at UCSF was in the transportation technology of newborn babies or neonates. His contributions to medical advancements do not go unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Freeman Bradley was not only an incredible asset to advancing medical research, but he also was an active member in UCSF&#8217;s Black Caucus. The Black Caucus is a club at UCSF whose mission statement is &#8220;The Black Caucus is a forum open to all Black-identified individuals and allies on this campus. Here they may openly express themselves regarding matters of race as they affect life on the campus and in the community. The Black Caucus serves as an instrument for the formation of a Black consensus on those racial matters that affect every person on this campus. This consensus will then be presented to the Administration for appropriate action.&#8221; One of the founding members and President of the Black Caucus, David Johnson, worked to create this community where Black members of UCSF could have their needs and concerns met. During Freeman Bradley&#8217;s time at UCSF and as an active member of the Black Caucus and used his calm temperament to make sure issues could be addressed and changes made. Mr. Bradley is quoted saying that even though he was criticized for staying diplomatic, he knew that it was the way to be more successful in the long run. In a 1983 interview of Mr. Bradley printed by Synapse, he shared his concerns with the lack of Black role models for youths in the sciences. He believes that minorities would be more likely to become a part of the medical field with more role models. Freeman Bradley is the perfect example of a role model to the youth and can be seen as an inspiration to all.</p>

<p>One of UCSF Archives and Special Collections’ most famous and beloved collections is the Japanese Woodblock Print collection – a collection of over 400 colorful and informative woodblock prints on health-related themes, such as women’s health and contagious diseases like cholera, measles, and smallpox. According to the Library website dedicated to the prints, they “offer a visual account of Japanese medical knowledge in the late Edo and Meiji periods. The majority of the prints date to the mid-late nineteenth century, when Japan was opening to the West after almost two hundred and fifty years of self-imposed isolation.”<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> The collection has been used, most recently, in a documentary about woodblock prints to be aired on NHK, Japan’s public broadcasting network, and has been a subject of enduring interest to researchers. I’ve heard colleagues wonder aloud about how UCSF came to own this unique collection, so I did some research. Naturally, an enterprising curator and librarian – Atsumi Minami, MLS – is to thank for the collection’s arrival at UCSF.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="828" height="1024" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atsumi-Minami.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-4642" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atsumi-Minami.jpeg 828w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atsumi-Minami-243x300.jpeg 243w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atsumi-Minami-768x950.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /><figcaption>Walters, Tom F., &#8220;Atsumi Minami with items from UCSF Library East Asian Collection,&#8221; 1968. UCSF History Collection. </figcaption></figure>



<p>While I was not able to find the exact dates of her employment at UCSF Library, I do know that Minami began working at UCSF Library in 1959, and soon took charge of a small collection of 70 titles of materials related to East Asian medicine started in 1963 by John B. de C.M. Saunders (a shortening of his full name, John&nbsp;Bertrand de Cusance Morant&nbsp;Saunders), then Provost and University Librarian.<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> Minami could read Japanese script, so she became responsible for the collection and was soon given free rein to begin collecting additional materials. In order to do this, Minami “traveled to Japan and China and purchased items from various smaller, private collections, acquiring the woodblock prints as well as hundreds of rare Chinese and Japanese medical texts, manuscripts, and painted scrolls.”<a href="index.html#_ftn2">[2]</a> Her collecting efforts spanned over 30 years, and produced a collection with over 10,000 titles. It would appear that Minami was still working at UCSF when <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31378005349033&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=341&amp;q1=%22Atsumi%20Minami%22">this informative article</a> was written for a 1986 issue of <em>UCSF Magazine</em>.<a href="index.html#_ftn3">[3]</a> At the time that article was published, the East Asian medicine collection was also the only active collection of its kind in the U.S., making it even more notable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another woman who was influential in shaping the East Asian collection was Ilza Veith, a German medical historian and former UCSF professor in both the Department of the History and Philosophy of Health Sciences and the Department of Psychiatry. Veith, who in 1947 was awarded the first ever U.S. Ph.D.in the History of Medicine from Johns Hopkins University, was also awarded later, in 1975, the most advanced medical degree conferred in Japan, the <em>Igaku hakase, </em>from Juntendo University Medical School in Tokyo.  Veith was extremely knowledgeable about both Chinese and Japanese medicine, and, in her time at Hopkins, translated <em>Huang Ti Nei Ching Su Wen</em>, or <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2287209/">The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine</a></em> – the oldest known document in Chinese medicine. Though the text has somewhat mythical origins that make its author and date a little difficult to determine, it probably dates from around 300 BC. Veith also helped shaped UCSF’s East Asian medicine collection by donating a number of her Japanese medical books. </p>

<p>I would encourage anyone interested in the collection to browse the prints on <a href="https://japanesewoodblockprints.library.ucsf.edu/about/">our website</a>, and to read more about their history via a <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3t1nc589/?query=UCSF+Japanese+Woodblock+Print+Collection">finding aid</a> on the Online Archive of California. Archives and Special Collections also houses the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf9x0nb73d/?query=Veith+(Ilza)+Papers">Ilza Veith papers</a>. While we don’t yet have an Atsumi Minami collection, we welcome donations and would appreciate any information that the present-day UCSF community has about this amazing woman.</p>

<p>We are currently more than halfway through Black History Month, a month that takes on special significance this year, following a summer of protests asserting, yet again, that Black Lives Matter. Archives and Special Collections would be remiss if we failed to mention the groundbreaking Black faculty at UCSF, both past and present, who have made significant contributions to the fields of medicine and psychology (as well as many others), and, who, in their work, have found ways to illuminate new facets of racism previously unconsidered and who, on their paths to success, have also sought to support and lift up others.</p>



<p>Mindy Thompson Fullilove is a social psychiatrist who served as Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS) from 1983 until 1990. Her work sits at the intersection of mental health and public health, and she focuses, in her own description, on the “sources and consequences of inequality, with a focus on the American city,” including segregation, gentrification, and the impact of these forces on the mental and physical health of Black families. <a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a> She is the author of numerous books, including <em>The Black Family: Mental Health Perspectives </em>and <em>Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America and What We Can Do About It.</em><a href="index.html#_ftn2">[2]</a><em> </em>Most recently, she has co-edited a volume titled <em>From Enforcers to Guardians: A Public Health Primer on Ending Police Violence. </em>In 2018, she gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI2n2MJgoeA&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">TED talk</a> which gives an overview of her work and her personal history and outlines her hopes for achieving equality.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4614" width="286" height="330" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM.png 878w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM-259x300.png 259w, ../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-1.48.33-PM-768x889.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px" /><figcaption>Mindy Thompson Fullilove</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Eritrean surgeon Haile T. Debas has, many times over, served as an example of what Black leadership can look like, and has shown how it can benefit others in a variety of ways. Debas, who came to UCSF in 1987 to serve as the Chair of the Department of Surgery, specializes in gastrointestinal physiology. During his time as Chair, UCSF “became one of the country&#8217;s leading centers for transplant surgery, the training of young surgeons, and basic and clinical research in surgery.”<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[3]</a> He then went on to serve as the Dean of the School of Medicine for 10 years, from 1993-2003. In 1997, he was appointed as the 7<sup>th</sup> Chancellor of UCSF, a position that he agreed to hold for one year while also serving as Dean of the School of Medicine.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/debas_h_300-893513824-O.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-4616" width="340" height="510" /><figcaption>Haile T. Debas, photo courtesy of UCSF University Relations</figcaption></figure></div>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Debas, in his long and distinguished career, has demonstrated a commitment to serving underserved areas, from his work in the Yukon Territories, where he practiced surgery early in his career, to a long-held dream of establishing a medical school in Eritrea. It was this commitment that led him to establish, in 2009, the UC Global Health Institute, which sought to leverage the expertise and resources of all ten UC campuses to address global health issues, which he says are “so big that single disciplines can’t tackle them.”<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[4]</a> He also served as Executive Director of UCSF Global Health Sciences (GHS), established in 2003, which focuses on issues like diseases of poverty, chronic illnesses, and the global threat posed by certain infectious diseases, like COVID-19.</p>



<p>His work in global health has informed his support for women’s empowerment movements, and he notes, “In global health, women’s empowerment is the critical element—nothing will be accomplished to a successful end without women’s support.”<a href="index.html#_ftn2">[5]</a> Debas also established the UCSF Department of Surgery’s Haile T. Debas Diversity Fellowship for Fourth Year Medical Students, which offers fourth year medical students a sub-internship in the Department of Surgery, as well as a $2,500 stipend.<a href="index.html#_ftn3">[6]</a>  Debas appears often in Archives and Special Collections materials, as a part of the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/search~S0?/X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D/X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)/1%2C17%2C17%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(%22School+of+medicine%22)+and+(Dean)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;16%2C16%2C">Office of the Dean’s records</a>, as well as in the Global Health Sciences records and the <a href="http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/search~S0?/X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D/X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(%22oral+history%22)/1%2C13%2C13%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(%22oral+history%22)&amp;m=a&amp;SORT=D&amp;6%2C6%2C">Oral History collection</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, My name is Shannon Foley. I am incredibly excited to be interning at UCSF’s<br>Archives and Special Collections this semester. I am currently in my last semester at the University of<br>San Francisco and will be graduating with a degree in Art History and Museum Studies.<br>Last semester I interned at the University of San Francisco’s Thacher Gallery. I helped<br>with their online exhibitions, a great experience learning how to navigate fully online<br>exhibitions.<br>At the University of San Francisco, the Art History and Museum Studies program offers<br>a diverse range of skills and experiences that I am excited to bring these skills to this<br>internship.<br>I grew up just an hour north of San Francisco in Sonoma County but have enjoyed<br>living in San Francisco for the past few years. When I am not in a class, I love to cook<br>and bake for my friends and family. I have also played tennis for the past ten years and<br>have enjoyed playing more during the pandemic. I am very passionate about traveling<br>and visiting museums abroad and locally.<br>On any given day, I can be seen walking my dog Louie and reading a good book.&#8221;</p>

<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services &amp; Accessioning Archivist</p>



<p>This coming Monday, September 28<sup>, </sup>2020, is the day UNESCO has designated as <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/accesstoinformationday?utm_source=ICA+Members+and+contacts+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=dfb0c50e3d-EMAIL_Newsletter_AUG_2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_84a7f06290-dfb0c50e3d-403675489">International Access to Information Day</a>. Their website notes that, this year, the day is focused on “the right to information in times of crisis and on the advantages of having constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information to save lives, build trust and help the formulation of sustainable policies through and beyond the COVID-19 crisis.” In a time of national and global crisis, this year’s theme may resonate particularly with Americans, whether it brings to mind the availability of voting information or attempts at voter suppression, or of the deliberate obfuscation of scientific data and fact by the highest levels of government.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>To this end, I’d like to celebrate libraries and archives, and their explicit mission to make information accessible. UCSF Library and its Archives and Special Collections, though closed to the public since the City of San Francisco’s “shelter in place” mandate on March 16<sup>th</sup>, continues to find creative ways to help students, faculty, staff, and outside researchers access the vast stores of information that the library and archives hold, and to find ways to facilitate access across great distances.</p>



<p>As the User Services and Accessioning Archivist, my job is to both make collections accessible through the accessioning process, and to help users navigate the various portals through which Archives and Special Collections shares its information. This may be through finding aids on the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/institutions/UC+San+Francisco::Special+Collections">Online Archive of California</a>, catalog records in the <a href="https://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Library catalog</a>, or through <a href="https://cinco-prd.s3.amazonaws.com/media/pdf/linton.pdf">brief inventories</a> attached to finding aids that tell a user what kinds of materials they can find in a given archival collection and to help them determine whether that particular collection may be of use to them.</p>



<p>Though the majority of my work is still remote, I have accessioned some exciting new collections on-site over the past couple of months, which will soon be available in the above-mentioned locations. Among these is an accrual to <strong>UCSF’s Black Caucus collection</strong>, focused on the Office of UCSF Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity and Diversity.&nbsp; The collection was donated to A&amp;SC in 2019, by Karen Newhouse, who served as Director of this office from 1970-2010, and includes materials documenting the work of various UCSF organizations committed to advancing diversity on campus, including Council of Minority Organizations (COMO), the Latin American Campus Association (LACA), and the pioneering Black Caucus organization, which was founded in May of 1968 – one month after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As the <a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf538nb3k7/">finding aid</a> to the initial deposit notes, the organization is open to all Black women and men on campus, and “was instrumental in the establishment of an Affirmative Action Office, minority training programs and focused attention on the need for increased minority student enrollment at the UCSF campus.”</p>

<p>Another exciting addition to the UCSF Archives includes the <strong>papers of Benjamin Libet</strong> – a neurophysiologist and professor of physiology at UCSF for nearly 50 years. Very recently donated to the Archives by his daughter Moreen, Libet’s papers consist of his personal files of research into the human brain, as well as extensive documentation of his experiments attempting to locate the origin of “free will.” The “Libet Experiment,” as it has come to be called, was conducted in the 1980s, and tried to determine whether conscious decisions first originate in the body or in the brain by asking subjects to perform simple movements while measuring their brain activity. This study seemed to indicate that the brain registers the decision to make a movement before a person is consciously aware of the decision to move, suggesting that decisions may originate in the body, and, as some have suggested, possibly disproving the idea of “free will.” This assertion of physical determinism has been much debated, and Libet’s experiments continue to be of great interest. His papers include some of the experimental devices that were constructed to help measure these brain activities, as well as handwritten notes, graphs and diagrams, and the data produced over the course these experiments. The collection is still in the process of being accessioned and inventoried, but will be available soon via OAC and the Library catalog.</p>



<p>If you’d like to learn more about any of these collections, or have questions about A&amp;SC’s extensive <a href="https://calisphere.org/UCSF/collections/">digital collections</a>, please feel free to <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/ask-an-archivist/">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>By Polina Ilieva, Head of Archives and Special Collections</p>



<p>When HIV/AIDS first seized the nation’s attention in the early 1980s, it was a disease with no name, known cause, treatment, or cure. Beginning as a medical mystery, it turned into one of the most divisive social and political issues of the 20th century. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) was at the forefront of medical institutions trying to understand the disease and effectively treat early AIDS patients.</p>



<p>Drawing on materials from the <a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/aids/">AIDS History Project</a> collections preserved in UCSF’s Archives and Special Collections, the UCSF Library presents <a href="https://calisphere.org/exhibitions/100/they-were-really-us/"><strong><em>“They Were Really Us”: The UCSF Community’s Early Response to AIDS</em></strong></a>, a new digital exhibition on Calisphere that highlights the ways UCSF clinicians and staff addressed HIV/AIDS from its outbreak in the 1980s to the foundation of the <a href="https://ari.ucsf.edu/">AIDS Research Institute</a> in 1996.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From medical professionals defining the disease and developing a model of care, to activists calling for treatments and public education, this exhibition amplifies the resilience of a community not only responding to its local needs, but also breaking ground on a larger scale with efforts that continue to impact HIV/AIDS care and research today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Erin Hurley, User Services &amp; Accessioning Archivist</p>



<p>Although, in 2020, advice like “wash your hands” and “cover
your mouth when you cough” seem fairly obvious and common sense, there was a
time when this was not the case. That time was March 1855, when the situation
in British hospitals outside of Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) during
the Crimean War had become so dire that Florence Nightingale and 40 other women
acting as trained volunteer nurses were finally allowed access to patients
(they had previously been denied access because of their gender). Hospitals
were overcrowded and extremely unsanitary conditions encouraged the spread of
infectious diseases like cholera, typhoid, typhus and dysentery, which Nightingale
recognized immediately. She implemented basic cleanliness measures, such as
baths for patients, clean facilities, and fresh linens, and advocated for an
approach that addressed the psychological and emotional, as well as the
physical, needs of patients. Her improvements brought a dramatic decline in the
mortality rate at these hospitals, which had previously been as high as 40%. </p>



<p>While Nightingale is well known as one of the world’s first nurses, she is less well known for her strikingly lovely data visualizations (including pie charts and a rose-shaped design called the “coxcomb”), which she used to highlight the number of deaths from diseases, in addition to deaths from wounds or injury, during the Crimean War. Nightingale, a mathematician and statistician, recognized the importance of eye-catching visuals in communicating the impact of her innovations. </p>
